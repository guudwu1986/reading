=================================================================[SDF-GPM4]===


  TOTEMS AND CONJURING
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 TOTEMS:

 Totems are special abilities shamans have. If you create a Shaman at the
start of the game or level one up to [SPIRIT SUMMONING: 3], you will get to
pick one of these special Totem Choices:


 o BEAR

  ~ Bear is powerful, gentle, wise, and a protector of all the natural world.

    The power of the Bear heals all allies within 3 tiles of the damage from
    the most recent attack.

    Cooldown: 3


 o CAT

  ~ Cat is secretive, sly, and very hard to trap.

    Cat grants: Dodge +1 for 3 rounds to all allies within 3 tiles when cast.

    Duration: 3   Cooldown: 1


 o COYOTE

  ~ Coyote is unpredictable and ever changing. It is the trickster.

    The Coyote grants all allies within 3 tiles Quickness +1.

    Duration: 3   Cooldown: 1


 o EAGLE

  ~ Eagle is proud and keen sighted. He sees all.

    The power of the Eagle boosts all allies within 3 tiles with a +15% to hit.

    Duration: 2   Cooldown: 1


 o RACCOON

  ~ Raccoon is cunning and curious with a strategic mind and a thief's insight.

    Raccoon grants a Movement bonus of +2 tiles to all allies within 3 tiles
    of the shaman when cast.

    Duration: 2   Cooldown: 1


 o CREATOR IDOL

  ~ Set all spirits break-away chance to 0% within 3 tiles of yourself.

  Cooldown: 3


 o DRAGONSLAYER IDOL

  ~ The power of the Dragonslayer aids all friends within a range of 3 with
    Damage Reduction of 3.

  Cooldown: 1


 o GREAT MOTHER IDOL

  ~ The power of the Great Mother heals all friends within 3 tiles of their
    most recent wound.

  Cooldown: 3


 o WILD HUNTSMAN IDOL

  ~ The Scorpion fears nothing because it can kill any foe.

    The Scorpion grants all friends within 3 tiles DMG +4, but reduces
    accuracy by -10%.

    Duration: 3   Cooldown: 1



 CONJURING:

 Shamans believe that their magic comes from a great totem spirit that guides
their life path (see above). This relationship allows them to summon spirits
and command them to do their bidding, letting them conjure spirits in a way
that mages cannot.

 You can conjure spirits by either using a FETISH that can be found or bought.
You can also at times find a "SPIRIT SHRINE" in the map where you can summon
a spirit from (these look like skulls in a diamond, and much like dragonlines
only your Shaman can see these icons).


 Once you have conjured a spirit you will need to control it. You do this by
giving it AP at the start of its turn. The more AP you give it, the more it
can do. However, the greater risk of the spirit breaking free. You can also
choose to just banish the spirit if you wish. Spirits come in different
elemental varieties, each with different abilities.

 If a spirit DOES break free it will do one of three things:

 - Die: The spirit will die outright.

 - Rampage: The spirit turns hostile to ANYTHING.

 - Revenge: The spirit will turn hostile to the SHAMAN who lost control.


 Spirits are extremely powerful allies when controlled and can easily turn
the tide in most fights with up to 4 AP a turn (more than you'll ever get),
so use them wisely.



==============================================================================
                          UNDERSTANDING THE MATRIX
=================================================================[SDF-GPM5]===


  BECOMING A DECKER
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 First of all, Decking requires a Cyberdeck and a data-jack. Picking the
Decker class gives you the cheapest cyberdeck automatically and the data-jack
upgrade as well... if you wanted to be a Decker, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you
pick the class just for these items, otherwise it is going to cost you a
pretty penny to get started (and money is very tight in the game as it is).
If you aren't going to be a Decker, Blitz, one of your companions will take
your place. He is more than competent for all of the Decking needs the game
throws at you and can support you in combat as well.


 The game is FULL of Decking opportunities and having a Decker on the team
is ALWAYS a good idea. There are a few missions where you won't need one,
but we'll cover which missions those are... more often than not though, they
will help in bypassing areas, opening up new areas, and finding additional
sources on income making them truly INVALUABLE.


  NAVIGATING THE MATRIX
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 When you enter the matrix your Decker is represented by you in IC form (which
is a white outline of your character model). You are free to travel around
like normal, but you will always be aiming to get to the nodes, hacking them
by killing everything around them, and then jacking-out.


 TRACE:

 This isn't a very used mechanic in this game, but I do recall it mattering
in at least one instance. At times you'll be hacking systems while your team
is still in stealth. In those cases, this will actually matter. Each Maxtrix
section allows you a max "trace" before you are recognized by the system.

 If you are still in stealth, this red meter at the bottom goes up as you
battle IC. If it does fill up, you will trigger an alarm and break stealth
in the real-world. You can use the  "Suppression" ability to help out here,
but honestly this is a very under-used mechanic in the game that you'll
hardly ever have to worry about.


  MATRIX COMBAT
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Whenever you enter combat in the matrix, you will enter into a "turn-based
combat" mode. Here you can use your programs (which are just attacks) as well
as your ESPs (which act like separate entities you can control, each with
their own special attacks). A Decker equipped with the latest Cyberdeck and
controlling multiple ESPs can make short work of almost any threat. Remember:
Your Cyberdeck dictates the IP (health), AP (number of turns) and number of
programs you can carry into the Matrix.

 MEAT SPACE:

 It is important to note that there will be times where you will be Decking
AND fighting out in the "Real World" (Meat Space). This obviously puts your
Decker in a very compromising situation, so you will have to rely on your
allies for protection. Also, if you lose all of your IP points (HP for the
Matrix), you will experience a "Dump Shock", kicking you out of the Matrix
force-ably, make you lose 25% of your HP, and cause you to lose 5 AP in the
real world. As a Decker, always carry a Heal IP program to keep yourself
healthy during combat.


  PAYDAY
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 The ultimate goal of the Decker: Payday. Inside the Matrix our main goal is
to find "Paydata" that we can sell on the Shadowland BBS back in Meat Space
and nodes with juicy info and optional objectives. Hacking these payday or
objective nodes is as easy as killing all of the enemies in the room and
then interacting with them.

 Now that we are done with that, it is time to continue. Let's head out and
go to the U-Bahn to head to Das Kesselhaus and continue our journey!

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Das Kesselhaus - Hotel & Nightclub. Crown jewel of Drogenkippe, the
    filthiest kiez in Berlin.

    Opening the door to the ground-level dance club is like bashing your head
    into a wall of sound. Flashing lights stab your eyes, and the air is
    perfumed with cheap synthohol and engine grease. Everything in here is
    cranked up to 11. A playground for the numb.

    Green Winters is somewhere in this building. You steel yourself for the
    sensory assault and step inside. The team makes a quick check of their
    weapons and follows you into Das Kasselhaus.


 Here we are, in the hotel/nightclub where Green Winters is staying out. We
need to find a way up to the hotel first and foremost though, as our objective
states:


 o Objective: Locate Green Winters

 o Objective: Find a Way to Access the Hotel Area


 Go talk to the bouncer here and ask about the hotel. We have some options
here, including bribing him for [200 Y] (which isn't worth it), or by using
either [Summoning: 3], [Strength: 5] or [Etiquette: Gang] to intimidate him
into telling you about the hotel.


777: Self Note: This just has him tell you about Frank I believe, but I need
                to verify this still. If you can verify this, let me know!


 All of those options are unneeded though: the bouncer lets you in regardless
and we have ways to get into the elevator still. First, stop by the bar to
listen in on the bartender and a junkie. Well then...

 Talk to Silke afterward and offer to help her for info. She will agree and
let you know of several things, including the floor manager, Frank and some
of the rooms in the hotel (including a treasure in the penthouse). She asks
that you retrieve her stuff from Room 304 though, giving us two new objectives
after talking to her:


 o Objective: Retrieve Silke's Belongings

 o Objective: Talk to Frank


 You can talk to the bartender if you wish, but he's not very helpful unless
you want to buy cram (he sells cram for 150 Y - he has four of them). You can
also try to blackmail him, but it won't work.

 To the immediate north is a party girl who wants cram for you to party with
her (again, I ignore her due to the money cost). It is a good idea to ignore
her actually, as she doesn't give you any information and is just a waste.

 To the left, you will find the elevator. You can see it is closed for
maintenance here, but to the right is an electrical grid you can use if you
have the [Drone Control: 3]  skill, which lets you rig the building to call
the elevator. Even better, this won't alert the security.

 Next up we can talk to Frank, who is in the northeast corner of the club.


 (-NOTE-) Be sure to save here and try ATTACKING Frank for his key. This will
          unlock the "Application of Force" achievement if you are playing on
          STEAM.


 Go ahead and talk to Frank. He will barely give us the time of day, but if
you have [Intelligence: 3] you can lie to him, telling him that Sara needs the
key upstairs. If you have [Charisma: 5] you can even get 200 Y out of this.

 Other than that, you can get a range of options to get into the hotel, which
range from bribing him for [200 Y] or using the [Etiquette: Corporate] or
[Etiquette: Gang] abilities.


 If everything else fails, you can choose to take the elevator card off of
Franks's corpse if you wish:


  Fight (OPTIONAL): The Drug Pit
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 If for WHATEVER reason you can't do any of the options above... or you just
feel particularly blood-thirsty, you can kill Frank for his keycard. This
will lead into a bigger fight of course, as the guards aren't going to let
you get away with this. Frank himself is easy to take out at 10 HP so have
Glory do it. Beef up with Dietrich and have Eiger use her shotgun on the two
guards just to the south as they will group up (and you can take them out
together if you are lucky).

 Next up is the "Goon Boss" to the northwest and two more goons to the
south (the bouncer and an enforcer - who have some decent HP). Eiger will
really help here with her Sniper Rifle, so have her hang out where Frank was
and have Dietrich buff her up. Send Glory and your MC down to wipe up. Be
sure to pick up the [_HOTEL ELEVATOR KEY_] that Frank drops so you can
access the elevator afterwards.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 No matter what you choose, you will get into the elevator. Let's go through
it floor by floor:


  First Floor: Hotel
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Exit the elevator to see most of the doors are locked, including the one
just to your south. Room 101 is open though, so enter.

 The computer near the entrance wants a password, although if you have
[DECKING: 2] you can bypass the security protocol.


(-NOTE-) You can also just input the password "Naperville" if you want to
         crack the safe. The "Clue" for this is the Chicago poster nearby,
         and Naperville is a suburb of Chicago... I'm sure only a few
         people actually knew that! Credit to the Steam Forums for this one!


 Either way, crack the safe and you'll get an [_ARES PREDATOR (SMARTLINK)_]
from the safe. Not bad! In the back you can find [_342 Y_] by the bedside
table as well. Very nice!

 From here, head down the hallway to the north/south section. Head north first
and check out the broken wall up here. You can interact with it and with a
[STRENGTH: 3] check you can bust it down (which most class-based classes can
do - my Rigger had 3 STR for example). Inside you can check the table for the
[_FLOOR 3 BATHROOM CODE_], which is (2, 4, 7, 8).

 The next door to the north is just a bathroom and doesn't have anything
interesting in it. Head south now and you can enter the very last room, room
106. Inside you can find a [_BUMONA TRAUMA KIT_]. Nab it and head back to the
elevator.

 Head up to the second floor now.


  Second Floor: Employees Only
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This floor drops us off right in front of a door that, once you open, will
put you into a battle so get ready!


  Fight: New Management
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Finally, a fight! We are taking out some of the "new management" of the
hotel here: about five gang members in total. However we are spoiled a bit
in this fight: before opening the door you can see only two gang members,
which is nothing, but there are actually three more gang members that will
join in the fighting as we continue.

 We have a turn at least before we have to worry about re-inforcements, so
send everyone on one of the two enemies (the goon bosses have grenades, so
spread out a bit). Have Dietrich buff someone up with AP and have Glory use
her Adrenaline Shot and make sure to wipe out one enemy at least, even if it
puts you in the open. Stay away from the obvious yellow barrel to the right
though!

 The second turn will likely have a goon coming in from the right and a goon
coming in from the top (oddly enough, there are two goons in the top room but
one likes to stay up there for some reason). The second round you can likley
take out two enemies, but focus on one if needed. You may get a chance this
round or the next to blow the barrel if an enemy heads over there, which you
should take advantage of as it will do extreme damage to them. Have Dietrich
continue to support and heal in the second and third rounds (Aim and Heal)
and wipe out the enemies in the main area. Finish off the battle by storming
the upper room and wiping the rest of the enemies out.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the fight, head north to the hotel administration computer and use
it. The first option here will give you info on people if you put in their
name, which is handy for what we're doing... go ahead and type in "Winters"
here to learn that he is on "Floor 4, Room 405". Read the notes attached to
the name for the [_ROOM 405 CODE_], (1, 9, 8, 9). This will come in handy,
and I will remind you of the code later so no need to memorize it or anything.
You can also type in "Silke" to learn that she is in Floor 3, Room 304.

 The second option here lets you search via room numbers, but its not quite
needed. The third option requires an "Admin Password", which we don't have
yet.


(-NOTE-) The admin password is actually "Admin". You will never find that
         by exploring either. Another thing you are just supposed to guess
         at, I suppose. It unlocks notes, but doesn't actually tell you
         anything you didn't get up above. Meh.


 The only other thing we can do is head into the right hallway and north,
which leads to the bathroom on this level. Here you can find a treasure on
the ground: the [_MAINTENANCE KEY FOB_], which can unlock the maintenance
doors throughout the hotel.


 Let's actually make a quick trip back to the first floor.



  First Floor: Hotel
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Head into the room to the south now that you have the maintenance key and
you can loot [_77 Y_] from the maintenance room. That's all we had to do,
so head on to the third floor now.


  Third Floor: Hotel
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Head out into the hallway and south, using the key fob we picked up on the
second floor to enter the maintenance room where you can find some [_CRAM_].


 The open door to the north has an enemy inside so BEFORE you open it you
should position your troops within shooting distance of the door as if it
was opened. Or... at least get Eiger in shooting range (so she can shoot up
into the room right away), but be careful of clumping people together as
this enemy has an AoE attack. Save and then open the door to get into this
short and sweet fight. Do note that it is ENTIRELY optional as we get no
reward for doing this... but, but battle!


  Fight (OPTIONAL): Someone's Pet?!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is a short fight if you are prepared and have Eiger set up to shoot
right away before opening the door (as I recommended up above). Just doing
this one thing will help A TON.

 The enemy you find here is a "Scorpyrine", a giant scorpion monster with
a health dose of HP and an AoE spit attack that can do some damage and poison
you at the same time. Still, if you have Eiger in position, you can buff her
with Dietrich and get three sniper shots in, all but killing the beast. If
that doesn't do it, your teammates follow-up attacks will definitely finish
the job. As long as you can get this done in one turn (which you should be
able to), don't worry about your injuries and take the scorpion out.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 If you did kill the scorpion, you can head inside the room and read the
note on the fridge and... yep, this was Steven's Pet. We're monsters... well,
monster's killing monsters...


 Head down the hallway and to the north/south hallway. Head north first up to
the bathroom, which is locked up. You can interact with the terminal here to
be asked for a code. We got this code on the first floor, the [_FLOOR 3
BATHROOM CODE_], which is (2, 4, 7, 8). Input the code and the door will open
for you. You can raid the drug station in here for some [_JAZZ_]. Yep, that
is all there is here... kinda disappointing to be honest.

 Head south now to the two open doors (rooms  304 / 305). Head into room 304
first to enter Silke's Room. You can pick up all of her belongs here, which
are [_SILKE'S ENCODED CREDSTICK_], [_SILKE'S TEDDY BEAR_] and finally
[_SILKE'S SIGNED COOKBOOK_]. Nice stuff. This gives us an update on our
objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Return Silke's Belongings


 You COULD go return this stuff now, but we'll be able to soon. Before you
do that, head to room 305 first and head into the back. Here you will find a
destroyed floor that you can jump down. Go ahead and do so to be back on the
second floor.


  Second Floor: Employees Only
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As you gather your bearings you will see you have scared a cook half to
death... and there is another man who has bled out nearby. Well, that's not
good. Go ahead and talk to the cook here. You can learn why he's locked
himself into the kitchen and, if you have [INTELLIGENCE: 3] you can point
out that the body should have gone into the freezer nearby (doing this will
net you Karma Gained: 1). You can also ask him about info about the hotel to
learn the [_ROOM 401 CODE_]  (5,8,7,0). Finally, once you attempt to leave,
you can tell him that you've cleared out the gang members and he'll end up
making a run for it.


 Let's head back to Silke now to return her stuff. Take the elevator back to
the club level.


  Ground Floor: Club
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Return to Silke now and give her the items back. Note that if you have
[CHARISMA: 3], you can ask for some money (although that seems rather...
shady to do).


 777: Self Note: How much can you charm out of her? And does it affect
                 the karma gained?


 Give Silke her items back and you will gain some karma for your good deeds!

 (Karma Gained: 1)

 Talk to her again about shaking her cram habit next. Now, this is a bit of
a crap-shoot, but it is likely you can pass TWO of these next checks. Here
you need to pass TWO of these checks in order to convince Silke that she does
indeed need help: pass either [INTELLIGENCE: 3], [BIOTECH: 1], [CHARISMA: 3]
or [ETIQUETTE: STREET].

 Passing two of these checks will convince her that she needs help, allowing
you to send her to Kreuzbasar and Samuel's clinic (she is an Ork after all).
This will net you some karma as well:

 (Karma Gained: 2)

 With that done, let's head back to the elevator and head to the fourth
floor to continue looking for Winters.


  Fourth Floor: Hotel
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is the floor Winters was on, so we're making some progress at last. The
first thing to do is to check out the maintenance room to the south. You can
find a [_CAVALIER FRAG GRENADE_] here. Next, check out Room 401 to see that it
has a keypad and thanks to talking to the cook on the second floor we have the
[_ROOM 401 CODE_]. Entering this room results in an optional fight, but we do
get a few treasures as a result (see below to see if the treasures are worth
it too you). If they are, go ahead and put in the code (5,8,7,0) and enter the
battle here:


  Fight (OPTIONAL): In the chop-shop
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Like other fights, this one will have enemies coming out of different rooms
as it continues, but at the start there is a lone doctor in the main room.
Take him out, but spread out as well as you don't want to be grouped up. I
would leave most of your team outside the door, with Dietrich providing support
and Eiger with her sniper rifle. Glory can afford to take a hit if she charges
in, so no worries there.

 The second turn onward will bring in a man from the back and a man from the
right. Still, you have them out-gunned and out-numered, so wiping them out
shouldn't be an issue. Focus one at a time to take them out faster.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Once the fight it over, check out the cabinet in the back of the main room
for a [_SCHEMATIC: AUTO-INJECTOR (HYPER)_]. This is for those of you that
modify their body at chop-shops. The left room also has an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_]
you can take. Not too bad of a haul.


 Head down the hallway to the north/south split. You can head north and check
out the bathroom if you want, but there's nothing in there. Head south instead
and interact with the Room 405 keypad. To remind you, we already have the
[_ROOM 405 CODE_], which is (1, 9, 8, 9). We found this code in the computer
terminal on floor two (by typing WINTERS into the guest look-up). The door
will unlock.

 Head inside and into the door beyond to reveal... a corpse. Wonderful. Go
check it out to see that Winters has apparently suffered the same fate as
Monika.

 Go check him out to see that he did write some number down before he died:
9 1 6 1 2. Probably important. Proceed through the dialog until your team is
done commenting on him, giving you an objective:


 o Objective: Search Green Winters' Room


 There are two paintings to check out here. The right one has nothing but the
left one hides a safe. Thanks to Winter's dying message (9 1 6 1 2), we know
the safe code. Open it up to get a [_BUNDLE OF OLD DISCS_] and two objectives
after taking them out of the safe:


 o Objective: Return to the Kreuzbasar

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Answer the Vidphone


 (-SPECIAL NOTE-)

 The second one is optional but highly recommended, ESPECIALLY IF YOU AREN'T
A DECKER. Don't miss this call!

 (-END SPECIAL NOTE-)


 Answer the vidphone to talk to a man who claims to have a deal for you. He
is stuck in this place thanks to the new gang and offers to break you into
the penthouse vault if you cover his escape. You can ask if he is a decker
here with a [DECKING: 3] that doesn't do much. You can also ask about the
new gang with an [ETIQUETTE: GANG] option that reveals more dialog. In the
end he tells you to meet him in Room 505 to go for the vault.

 Looks like we'll be making a side-trip...


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Meet the Man on the Top Floor


 We may as well go for the goods, so head to the top floor now.


  Top Floor: Penthouse Suite
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As soon as you load in, you'll see Blitz in the room nearby (Room 505). Go
meet up with him and agree to bring him along with you on your way to the
vault. He comes with standard decker gear and an SMG. You will have an even
easier time in battles now with FIVE party members. I recommend using Blitz
to mark targets early in fights and follow up with focused SMG fire.


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Open the Vault


 Room 501 up north is empty, but should be quickly explored as the left room
in here has an [_ADVANCED DRONE REPAIR KIT_]. Save after picking it up as
there are a few fights coming up (best to be safe). As you head towards the
hallway you will get into a fight:


  Fight: Hallway to the Vault
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 You will fight three enemies in total here, and there are plenty of cover
spots in the hallway but it is also very cramped (so yet, if you push two
people up, a grenade is very likely). Put Eiger in the far back (back right
cover spot) and have her snipe the enemy furthest away. Have Glory or your
main character rush the line after that, with everyone else spread out for
support (again, Blitz's Mark Target is useful but use it sooner rather than
later - he can make some SMG shots after that).

 Eiger will clean up the far enemy and work on the second while the rest
of your team kills the close enemy and goes for the second. You far outnumber
them, so as long as you spread out this is an assured win.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 There is another fight coming up, as soon as you open up the door in the
hallway, so be ready!


  Fight: Heavy Metal
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 If you have a RIGGER, this fight is beyond easy. This is because up on the
upper right wall, right past the door, is an electrical panel you can interact
with, and if you have [DRONE CONTROL: 3] you can destroy the large turret and
drone that you ran into.

 If not, hunker behind the boxes with your ranged characters (snipe with
Eiger) and take out the turret and gun. Note that they aren't alone, as there
is an Enraged Troll in the northeast room. Let him walk out though, and kill
the machines first.

 Have Dietrich use the Summon Spirit Shrine in the middle of the room for
some extra re-inforcements. You will summon "Typhoon", who is a water spirit
that has two unique attacks: Big Wave (which grants target +2 Dodge) and
Manabolt 1 (which pierces two armor).

 After taking out the machines, deal with the Troll. Eiger (with her shotgun)
or Glory are perfect to run up against him with Dietrich healing them as
needed (swap them out if they take two rounds of damage).  Finish off the
Troll and the fight will be over.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the battle, enter the room the gun was guarding and we'll get a very
unnecessary objective...


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Loot the Vault


 Just.. what were they expecting us to do here? Take in the sights? Sheesh,
grab the item to the north for some [_BLISS_] and pick up the [_BROKEN DRONE_]
and take it with you. We'll fix this later (more on this thing later). To the
south is the [_DRUG FORMULA (JAZZ)_]. Finally, interact with the safe to get
a net total of [_1,429 Y_] and some[_NITRO_]. A rather poor haul, really, but
we do get a karma reward for looting the place: (Karma Gained: 1).


 Head back down to the ground floor (the club) and leave. As you leave, Blitz
will ask you if you need a decker. This is an IMPORTANT DECISION obviously:
if YOU ARE NOT A DECKER, TAKE BLITZ ALONG. You should really just take him
along anyways, but there is a chance to part ways here even with a unique
[DECKER] dialog options, but again...


 (-SPECIAL NOTE-) TAKE BLITZ WITH YOU!


 OK, that should get the message across...


 (-NOTE-) You will get the "Novahot or Not?" achievement on Steam for taking
          in Blitz as part of your crew.


 And now we exit this place and head back to our hideout, the Kreuzbasar.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your team makes its way back to the nearest U-Bahn station. Twenty
    minutes later, you're on a return trip to the Kreuzbasar, leaving the
    filth of Drogenkippe far behind. But the image of Green Winters' twisted
    corpse continues to linger in your mind.

    You lift one of the discs that you pulled from Winters' safe to the light.
    Reflections dance off of its surface.

    With luck, you'll soon have the answers that you've been looking for.


 Once we get back to town, you will get the first note below. Be sure to check
out everyone's new moves and pick some out (note that BLITZ doesn't get a level
2 choice here - just your starting team).


 (-NOTE-) As you lead your team through the shadows, your companions will
          continue to develop and learn new combat skills. Clicking the
          icon in the lower right-hand corner of the screen will open the
          Crew Advancement menu. When this icon is highlighted, one or more
          of your companions is eligible to learn a new combat skill.

          At each advancement level, you may choose one of two possible
          combat skills for each of your runners. Choose wisely.


 (-NOTE-) This feature is actually only for the "Director's Cut" version
          of Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The original title didn't have this,
          but you can also see this in the third game in the series:
          Shadowrun: Hong Kong.


 We will get the following objective and a whopping 8 Karma to spend on
ourselves as well. Not bad at all!


 o Objective: Discuss Your Findings with Amsel

 (Karma Gained: 8)


 Feel free to spend your Karma if you wish, but note the items for sale in
the shop boxes below to MAKE SURE you can equip what you want. We have only
unlocked "B-Level" items so far (meaning A and S level items are yet to be
unlocked, so you can't buy the best Decker Rig or an S-Class drone... yet).
At least we have enough money to buy things now.

 But first, we head to the hideout!


 (-NOTE-) A general "good to know" note here: While talking to your team
          members after every mission, you can usually tell when they are
          done talking if they only give you a generic reply when you talk
          to them. If not... you may be able to get more info out of them by
          talking to them again.


 Once you enter the hideout, you will see Blitz has taken up residence in
the first area. You can talk to him here (again - we want to TALK TO EVERYONE
AFTER EVERY MISSION) to get some dialog on how he got himself into that
situation at the hotel. In fact, if you have [INTELLIGENCE: 2] here you can
get "what really happened" out of him. He... may have had more to do with the
incoming gang than he let on...

 Next up is Dietrich. Talking to him gives you some background on his past.
More specifically, how he was the face man of a punk rock band, named
"MESSERKAMPF!" and his call to the Dragonslayer totem. I always thought that
Dietrich's pull to Dragonslayer was well-picked considering the overall plot
of the game so far...

 Eiger is up next and is still a bit salty. Here you should pick the option
that says "we're going to have a problem". This shows Eiger you have backbone
and gets more respect from her than the "good" option. Good to know!

 Finally we have Glory. You will want to talk to her twice actually, asking
her about her chrome each time (see the note above!). At the second time of
asking you can get into a story from her. She starts with her childhood, but
after telling you a bit of her upbringing she will cut the story off, telling
you to come talk to her another time.


 Now that we're done talking to everyone, check your mission computer for
the PAYDATA we sold to get the payday: [_495 Y_]. This plus the money we
looted earlier means we can definitely buy things out in town.

 Talk to Paul next to show him the stack of DVDs. He will tell you of their
old format (heh...) and to go see Maliit about finding something that can
play back a DVD.


 Go visit Maliit outside of the hideout (just to the south... she is the
Decker/Rigger shop) and ask about the DVD player. She doesn't have a player
but does have a monitor that we need. Tell her to put it on Paul's tab to
acquire the [_ANCIENT MONITOR_]. She will also tell you to talk to an old man
in the junkyard to see about the player itself.

 While you are here, you should give her the broken drone that we found on
our last outing. She will look into fixing it up for us. You can also shop
with her if you wish, but we will go shopping down below.


 Head to the right where the yellow mission marker points to talk to an old
man named Schrotty. Ask him about a DVD player and he will produce one after
digging around, but will soon eye you over and ask for 500 Y payment.

 Here you can either pay him the [500 Y] (which you should NOT DO), or if you
have [STRENGTH: 4] you can intimidate him out of it (which makes you a jerk,
to be honest). You can also call his price "ridiculous", which lowers the price
to [350 Y], although if you have [CHARISMA: 3] you can halve that price even
further. ALL of these payment options are NO GOOD.

 Instead, ask him if he will trade anything. This prompts Schrotty to say that
he would trade the DVD player for a cup of Turkish Coffee. Agree to that
request and head to Altug's place. You can buy a cup of Turkish Coffee from
him for 50 Y. Do so for the [_TURKISH COFFEE_], take it to Shrotty and you
will get your [_DVD PLAYER_]. This also grants you a nice karma boost:


 (Karma Gained: 1)


 Head back to Paul now and give him the monitor and player. Interact with the
DVD player and play all of the tracks in order (there are quite a few). There
is some very good story progression here as you meet "Green Winters", or as
he is being called, "Hermie". You will learn he was looking for his brother
Adrian Vauclair, the "Dragonslayer". You get to see what a dragon is capable
of as well and see Hermie break down after time. He details the reason for
your Harfeld Manor run and his impending doom.


 Well then... this is. Not good. All signs point to the fact that we are now
fighting against the dragon Firewing. The team agrees that finding Dr. Vauclair
is now our priority, and that we need to talk to the F-State's top information
broker, Alice.

 Paul will really step up here (proving to me at least that he is firmly on
our side) by ponying up the 10,000 Y needed for Alice's fee and giving it to
you on  [_AMSEL'S ENCODED CREDSTICK_], along with our new objective:


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to Meet Alice


 We aren't quite done yet in the Kreuzbasar:


 (-NOTE-) Before we go meet Alice, let's run down the inventory of the local
          shops. Be warned: there are a LOT of shop blocks here. Just scroll
          past them all if you don't want to buy anything.

          Chances are that you can find SOMETHING here worth buying though,
          as you should have 2,000+ Y to spend at this point.


 First up to the south is "Data Haven", Holyey's shop. You should already
have given her the broken drone already, so all that is left is the shopping!

 Next up to the southeast is the group Talismonger's Shop. Head in and buy
whatever you may need. Of special note here is the fact that you can talk to
the shop owner, Aljernon, about his views on magic and religion. You will get
some references to Glory's story as well if you talked to her.

 OK, next up let's go see ol' Zaak Flash just to the north. Of note,  you can
give him the [_FORMULA: JAZZ_] item you have to add Jazz to his sales menu.
If you are going to take stims, this is one of the better ones for the AP
bonus, but still...

 Next up is the TRIAGE Clinic to the northwest, where if you are inclined to
get chromed up you can undergo the knife. More importantly, you can give the
doctor the [_AUTO-INJECTOR (HYPER)_] plans that we found earlier to add it to
his cyberware list.

 I'm getting kind-of bummed that we're giving these people FREE STUFF and
basically getting no reward for it... GRRR...

 That is pretty much it for shopping, but    |   Still Better Than Life?!   |
you can head to the northwest again to talk  |------------------------------|
to Simmy (see the sidebar), who is running   | The program Simmy is running |

pub that is actually a new edition to the    '------------------------------'
"Director's Cut" version of the game (which makes it new to me as well!).


 There isn't much to talk about here however. Inside you can talk to an NPC
named "Lucky Strike" and discuss Monika and her influence on the community
(and her distaste of that fact). May as well go through all of her dialog.

 Exit and head south to the U-Bahn (note that you can talk to Laine on the
way, with a unique dialog option if you have [Biotech: 3] for some flavor
text). Enter the U-Bahn and you will automatically head to "The Rabbit Hole".



  THE RABBIT HOLE
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Time to contact Alice. Enter the small area and to the northeast in the
cubby you can find some [_HYPER_]. Grab it and then interact with the nearby
arcade machine. Insert the credstick that Paul gave you and soon you will
meet the notorious information broker.

 Tell her your intention to find Dr. Adrian Vauclair, whom she recognizes
right away but agrees he has been missing for a long time. If you have
[DECKING: 4], you can take a stab at Alice's identity (read the note I
put down below for the summary if you want), but either way Alice will tell
you her fee is 50,000 Y and that we will need to come back with the money
while she looks into your request. You can comment on the price point if you
wish, but the price is non-negotiable.


 (-NOTE-) Interested in Alice's Identity? Here is the text you get if you
          happen to have [DECKING: 4]:

          "There was a member of Echo Mirage named Alice. Alice Haeffner.
          She died back in 2029, fighting the Crash Virus. Rumor has it, she
          still exists in the Matrix. Still calls herself Alice, too."


 o Objective: Discuss Your Findings with Amsel


 Head back to the hideout and let Paul know how it went. He won't be too
surprised at the price, and will state that he has a couple of jobs lined up.
He is also looking into what he can find out WITHOUT going into the matrix
as well as into the skin-graft Ork (Maliit is looking into the damaged DVDs
as well). Once you are done talking with Paul, we will have our work layed out
for us:


 o Objective: Meet with Samuel Beckenbauer About a Job

 o Objective: Raise 50,000 Y to Pay Alice


 As you can tell, that second objective there is going to take some time...
yeah, but we have a good excuse to go shadowrunning at the very least!

 Go ahead and check out the computer here for the jobs. Go ahead and accept
the Pharma Cleanup job right now, but the other one we'll have to go talk to
Samuel about in person (like Paul mentioned).


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to the Pharma Laboratory Complex


 Go see Samuel now, just to the north of the hideout. He will tell you about
a chemical compound that a Metahuman Hate Group has and asks you to stop them.
Note that if you have the [Etiquette: Socialite] option, you can ask Samuel
for some more pay. See the self note below but note that the default payday is
22,000 Nuyen.


 777: Self Note: I have read you can get 500 Y more if you have that etiquette,
                 but have not confirmed it for myself. The information seems
                 quite solid, though.


 Go ahead and accept the quest now.


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to Schattennest


 OK, now we have two options on what to do so head to the U-Bahn and you will
run into Dietrich. Go ahead and hear Dietrich out here about the Humanis run
to learn of his nephew, Alexander. He will ask to go with you on this run in
order to "talk some sense" into the boy, which isn't much to ask for (plus if
you aren't a mage, Dietrich is always awesome to have anyways).


 It is time to pick a mission. Let's go ahead and do the Humanis run first,
for no real reason (other than it is the first on the list). So go ahead and
pick:


 "Assemble the team and travel to the Schattennest to infiltrate the Humanis
  Policlub compound."


 Time to go earn a payday...


 (-NOTE-) You can HIRE runners to go with you, but that takes money (of
          course) and your main team is free to take along throughout the
          entire game. I'll be doing the missions (and guide) with our main
          team, but the option is there!

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The U-Bahn rattles to a halt at the edge of Kreuzberg. You're only a
    few blocks away from Schattennest, the kiez that Maxim and his smugglers
    call home.

    According to Samuel, they should be expecting you.


 We'll start out on the streets near Schattennest. Dietrich (assuming you
brought him like he asked) will thank you for bringing him along, adding an
objective to our original one:


 o Objective: Make Contact with the Smugglers

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Help Dietrich Find His Nephew


 Head north and talk to the vendor if you wish. You can buy something, but
it is a waste of money as you don't get any info. Head forward and use the
phone both to be asked to find a list of the "Current and past donors to the
Humanis Policlub", which gives us an optional paydata objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Find the Humanis Donor List


 Go talk to the dwarf you find who won't STOP you from getting in so be
cordial but tell him you are going and he'll let you past. You'll find the
smugglers beyond him.

 Talk to the smuggler boss, Maxim, and soon you will be in a van heading in
to the compound. However you will be stopped along the way by a gang. Beacuse
of course you will! Heh.


 The gang is nammed "Rammbock" and claims to have taken out the former gang
Surfturf last week (you gotta love these names). Of course the new gang is
trying to get a toll on the bridge (500 Y per Van), which leaves you with some
options:


 1) Help the Smugglers

 2) Attack Everyone

 3) Negotiate with the Gangers


 The first option is the normal one: teaming up with the smugglers to take
down the gang members. Doing so means TWO easier fights in the future (one
right now) and a money/karma choice coming up (read the note below).

 The second option is taking out everyone. This is the greedy choice, as
you would do this for the chemical pay, but it does make two fights quite a
bit harder (including this one). Again, there is a choice here so read the
note below.

 The third choice is to try and reason with the gang. You will need to pass
either an [ETIQUETTE: GANG] or a [WILLPOWER: 3] check to do so however. I
didn't have either of the necessary options to do so however, so read the
self-note below (that I still need to confirm...).


 777: SELF NOTE: Supposedly, if you have the [ETIQUETTE: GANG] or
      [WILLPOWER: 3] you can bypass this upcoming fight all-together.
      BK still needs to check this out though.


 (-NOTE-) There is a BIG DIFFERENCE between betraying the smugglers or
          helping them. The biggest thing is how much help you get in this
          fight and another one coming up. This can change the fights from
          easy to hard.

          The other change worth noting is that if you TAKE OUT the smugglers
          you will get [_2,000 Y_]. If you help them throughout the mission,
          you will instead gain (KARMA GAINED: 1). So... which one is worth
          more to you? Personally, I'm going with the karma...

          (END NOTE)


 Make your pick and let's do it!


 o Objective: Eliminate the Gangers and the Turrets

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Keep Max Alive


  Fight: Paying the Toll...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight can be easy or rough obviously, depending on your choice up
above. The "easy path" is of course working with the smugglers, as it is
less people firing at you.

 The first thing you need to do is get everyone away from each other. Your
team is WAY too close together to start with and you need to spread them out
a bit. At least SOMEONE should shoot one of the multiple radiation barrels to
the southeast though: they will chain-react and explode and will greatly hurt
the three gangers below (if not outright kill at least one of them). Also, the
turrets will get hurt a ton too.

 If you are working with the smugglers, take cover and focus on wiping out the
enemies to the southeast while sending Glory up to the north to help take out
the two gangers up above. On the second turn, two gangers will show up from the
northwest building, so you'll have to focus on them after taking out the
southern enemies. Note that one is a conjurer, so focus on them as soon as you
can.

 The smugglers won't help too much, but at least they aren't hurting us (the
big ork with the grenade launcher seemed to help the most). Still, between the
extra guns and the exploding barrels, this fight is fairly easy.

 You will be rewarded later in the episode if you HELP the hunters with a
small karma reward (and these easier fights)...



 If you are NOT working with the smugglers, the FIRST THING you do is run to
the north. Using both AP: just get the heck out of the way. The gang members
and smugglers will focus on each other and we can get set up to the north and
hold our own ground up here.

 First, note that there are magic ley lines up here that Dietrich can use for
some additional benefits. Note that there is also a summon spirit shrine up
here where you can summon an "Inferno". Let's go over what he can do really
quick: besides its basic spell, it can also use "Flamethrower 2" (a direct
damage spell), "Blindness" (which is self-explanatory) or "Inferno" (which
does 10 HP damage per turn). Perfect to summon and send out to the front lines
on the third turn or so.

 Set Eiger up in the north with her sniper rifle, hasted and aimed. Have Glory
and your MC take cover elsewhere, even if they can't shoot (Glory can with her
pistol) and take pot-shots when you can. Have Eiger (or SOMEONE) shoot the
radioactive barrels as soon as you can to catch the enemies down there. From
here wait a few turns until the enemy actually starts focusing on you to make
your moves.

 Focus on taking out the gang members if you can, leaving the smugglers for
last (except maybe the troll with the grenade launcher) if you can help it
as the gang will win if left alone (and any time they fight each other is a
plus). Keep in cover and clear out areas of the map once the two sides have
thinned each other out a bit and this fight is yours.

 If you killed off the smugglers, check wherever Max was to find an item on
the ground. Pick it up for a credstick worth [_2,000 Y_].

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 No matter which path you take, you will be awarded immediately with a karma
reward:


(KARMA GAINED: 3)


 Go ahead and enter into the van once you are ready and we will head to the
compound....

 Once you get there the team will note that there is no one here to meet us,
"Almost like they didn't expect us to make it." Well then... go ahead and go
through the parking lot and courtyard and enter the building to continue.



 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The Humanis compound smells like a locker room, and doesn't look much
    better. Calling the building "run down" would be an understatement; paint
    is peeling off of the cheap duraplast walls, and the tiles on the floor
    are mired with decades' worth of grime. It's an old, ugly place, perfectly
    suited to the old, ugly ideology being practiced here.

    You enter the compound. The information that Samuel Beckenbauer sent you
    here to find lies somewhere ahead.


 Note the people running away when you enter! Up to the north is a room with
a bunch of lockers in it. Each one of them is numbered 1-6 and is locked, so
no goodies for you (or at least not yet!).


 OR... if you wished, you could open them now. The codes are below. You can
find the codes by hacking a computer shortly, but only if you have the skill
[DECKING: 4] or by guessing their password. Still, for now, here is the list:


 Locker 1 (Code 3706): [_NITRO_]

 Locker 2 (Code 1409): Note from Volker

 Locker 3 (Code 2619): [_HUMANIS OFFICE DOOR CODE_]

 Locker 4 (Code 4176): [_273 Y_] (random)

 Locker 5 (Code 1106): [_ARMORY DOOR CODE_]

 Locker 6 (Code 2114): Empty


 Head left now and you'll see the Armory. If you saw above, you noted that
the armory password is gotten through a locker code, which itself is gotten
from hacking a computer. You can wait until you get it from doing the above
things... or you can just enter the code now. The code for the door here is
"Purity", so enter it and enter the armory.

 Time to loot! The first two "medical supplies" boxes will give you [_ADVANCED
MEDKIT x2_] and a [_BUMONA GOLD TRAUMA KIT_]. Next up is the weapon racks to
the north. Loot them for a [_MOSSBERG DMDT_] as well as an [_ARES PREDATOR
(SMARTLINK)_], which is a gun we got last mission as well.

 You can interact with the turret here if you have [DRONE CONTROL: 4] to set
it up to attack your enemies. You may as well if you can. Finally we have the
grenade box. We get a lot here, including a [_RENRAKU FLASHBANG GRENADE_], a
[_CAVALIER FRAG GRENADE_], and a [_HE PHOSPHORUS GRENADE_].


 Head north and enter the kitchen area to find a note on the table, which
turns into [_RECRUIT KAPPEL'S LOCKER CODE_] ("Locker 3 Code: 2619"). This is
to MAKE SURE you get the office code as listed above, but still nice of them
to put it here.


 Head north and enter a warehouse room (note the graffiti on the wall) and
then inspect the turret. If you have [DRONE CONTROL: 4] here, you can turn
it on and set it to attack your enemies.

 To the right is a classroom with several terminals you can interact with.


 The lower left terminal can be hacked with [DECKING: 4]. If you do, you can
get the [_PAYDATA: HUMANIS SAFE HOUSE LIST_], which we can sell later.


 The terminal on the right can also be hacked with [DECKING: 4]. If you get
this one, you will get the [_RECRUIT ACCESS CODES_], which gives you the
locker codes for ALL of the new recruits. You also get the [_HUMANIS OFFICE
DOOR CODE_], which seems to be Volker's Office Password. Yeah, quite the haul
here really!


 The top terminal is also hackable with [DECKING: 4]. Doing this one will
give you the list of donors for the Berlin chapter of Humanis, which is what
our friends on the telephone wanted. This nets you the [_HUMANIS DONOR LIST_]
which will give us a payday later on.


 (-NOTE-) You can also get into ANY of these computers with the general
          default password "Humanisforever". Which, I suppose you were
          supposed to guess by it being their mantra, but still I'm ont sure
          many people would get this on their own...


 If you haven't already, go loot the recruit's lockers and loot the armory.
The passwords are up above, so be sure that you get all the free items you
can before you continue.


 Once you are ready, head north to the door and enter the code (which you
could have gotten from hacking the terminal or by looking at the note in the
3rd locker: "Pride". Enter it to unlock the door, then save.


 NOTE: There is a STEAM Achievement for letting the Humanis leader go
       coming up, so be sure to SAVE and RELOAD if you want to get it.


 Enter the room and pick up the [_"OPERATION: FALSE FLAG" PLANNING REPORT"_]
from the desk. This will make a number of people enter the door here and
confront you. Talk to Volker here however you wish, but even if you say you
want to join he won't buy it. Soon re-inforcements will come in, which just
happen to include... Alexander!

 Here, help Dietrich convince Alexander to join you. You can do this every
time without fail by telling him "Dietrich is Good" (which ends up being a bit
back-firing, but works) and then telling him that it is his choice. This will
net you ALEXANDER as a guest party-member for the rest of the mission.


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Get Alexander To Safety


 This also gets us into a fight! Go go go!


  Fight: Taking out the Trash
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight is a fun one and really has three stages to it. It definitely
helps having the turrets hacked if you've done so, but isn't 100% needed
honestly. Firepower will always get us through. We also get an objective
after the first turn (just FYI):


 o Objective: Escape with the Humanis Plot Information


 At the start of the fight, everyone should focus on the immediate threat
in the room, which is four enemies (assuming we have Alexander on our side
and all). Volker is fleeing however, so it is more like three enemies. Have
everyone but Eiger focus on taking these people out, including Volker who
has little health so should go down easily. You may NOT get everyone, but
you should be able to kill three out of four at least. You can finish them
off on the next turn.

 Eiger meanwhile will help us out a ton. I recommend giving her Aim or
Haste as soon as you can and setting her in front of the hallway, aiming
down to the six enemies coming up from the south. These enemies will get
held up A TON if you hacked the turret earlier (the turret itself doesn't
really help at all though), otherwise you need to hurry and defend your room,
but Eiger can wreck havoc on the enemies down below as they show up, likely
(or nearly) killing an enemy on each turn...

 As the lower enemies come up, have your decker go NORTH (following Volker)
and you can jack-in to the matrix port up here (see the matrix section down
below).


 (-NOTE-) If you already opened the armory and hacked the turrets, there is
          little reason to jack in here...


 No matter how good Eiger is, some enemies will show up. You will want to
play defensively here but it is OK to send in Glory if someone goes into the
left or right rooms as she can go one on one versus anyone. Once the enemy
clears up a bit, you can roll the rest of the enemies easily.


 You will notice the fighting ins't over quite yet. Head south with your
entire team (wait on your decker, if you have to) and there will be an enemy
down in the kitchen area (he may be wandering around or set up in the hallway
here, so be careful). Also note that you can summon a spirit at the summon
shrine in the kitchen, although he is rather un-needed. But he is a Typhoon
water spirit (the same kind you've seen before - with a "slow" spell added to
his move set).

 Near the entrance are three enemies set up and barricaded. If you have drones,
send them in the tunnel across from the dining hall for a pincer attack with
your main team and you can all attack at the same time. Eiger does a great job
doing long-range from the front of the armory, which I point out for a reason
as it helps for several turns having her there with Dietrich buffing her.

 Once you breach the room, three enemies from the east come out (which may
pincer your pincer attack), but their first moves are mostly movement. Take
out the first set of enemies and use the cover they were using, then mop up
the enemies that came in last (note that one of them is a melee weapon user).

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 (-NOTE-) You will get the "Stahl Out" achievement on Steam for taking out
          Stahl in this fight. This happens as soon as you kill him.

 (-NOTE-) You will get the "Everybody Deserves a Second Chance" STEAM
          achievement if you let the Humanis Leader go...


 o NET INFILTRATION: HUMANIS COMPOUND
 |
 |
 |  Our second matrix run, this time using either Blitz or your PC, I would
 | suppose. I did this one while doing the fight above, but your timing
 | shouldn't matter. Head forward to the second screen and you'll be at a
 | path split. Let's go right first...
 |
 |  (-NOTE-) Go LEFT first for the turrets if you haven't hacked them to
 |           your side yet.
 |
 |  Here, take out a lone white IC and then interact with the security
 | cameras datapoint. This puts the security cameras on your side, although
 | I don't see the point of it.
 |
 |  Next up, go back to the intersection and go up. Here you will fight a
 | total of three White IC, so take cover and hit the closest ones first to
 | take them out. The paydata here is the armory control panel, where you can
 | open up the armory doors. Very nice, as the loot up above shows you.
 |
 |  Lastly, return to the intersection and head left now. This leads to three
 | White IC (one down each path and one in the middle) that you can take out
 | (there is a handy piece of cover in the middle). Take them both out. Each
 | path here leads to a turret, so you should definitely turn them over to
 | your side BEFORE you make a push for the exit.
 |
 |  With all of that said, that is all there is to do here. Return to the
 | insertion point and jack out to get back into the fight!
 |

 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 Once you have shot your way out of the building, you will get another story
synopsis on your way back to the van.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You burst through the door to the Humanis compound and into the crisp
    night air. You're not far from your extraction point.

    Time to go.


 We get some objectives and another fight out her as well:


 o Objective: Eliminate Humanis Opposition

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Keep Max Alive


  Fight: Time to get out!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 There are QUITE A FEW enemies here and this fight is where keeping the
smuggler's alive from before really helps. This is the difference between
everyone being focused on us or not.

 If you have smuggler help, you will have five enemies in sight just past
the wall, and two in the back with the smugglers. You can use this wall to
hide behind and prep, which is great for Dietrich. You can set up Eiger on
the left side to snipe while the rest of the team moves forward slowly. If
we don't get to the smugglers in a reasonable amount of time, they will very
likely die.

 Make your way forward, focusing on taking down one enemy at a time as they
fall back towards the smugglers, who will help in their own way... (as
distractions). Nothing special here: just stick to cover and take out the
enemy one at a time.


 Without the smugglers, we are facing even MORE resistance (seriously, eight
plus enemies...) all trained on us. Of particular note, they have people set
up in the corners just past the wall partition, so watch your angles and put
softer targets against the wall (like drone controllers). It is the same
fight as last time, just go slower and make sure you spread out, taking out
one enemy at a time.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 (-NOTE-) If you helped the smugglers throughout the entire mission, you
          will get a bonus (Karma Gained: 1).


 Head to the van and talk to Max once you are done, who will have some dialog
but not much else.

 You'll also get a scene with Dietrich and Alexander once you click on the
van. Dietrich tells him where we are going and the tells you that the
Dragonslayer is pleased with our actions (heh...). He feels power flowing
through him but doesn't know what it will be yet.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The U-Bahn ride home feels especially comforting today. The Berlin chapter
    of the Humanis Policlub has suffered a terrible blow, and you're the one
    who dealt it. Volker Stahl's plan to incite a wave of bloody violence
    across Berlin has been derailed.

    It isn't often that a shadowrunner gets to prevent an atrocity on the job.



 Finally... back home. Paul will send us a call and asks us to come see him,
while the game goes over our objectives again...


 o Objective: Notify Samuel of the Humanis Plot

 o Objective: Talk to Amsel

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Return the Data to the Schockwellenreiter Payphone


 We also get our "mission complete" karma reward:


 (Karma Gained: 8)


                                             .------------------------------.
 First up, talk to Samuel and tell him how   |   Sunnier on the BTL trip?   |

course, and promises that the other Humanis  | This time, Simmy is singing  |
branches are about to be dealt with. Heh.    | as we approach her. The song |
                                             | she is singing is a direct   |
 Head north now and talk to Simmy, who is    | reference to Annie, which has|

to learn more about how her. She will also   '------------------------------'
make sure it is ok for her to stay here. To the northwest you can interact
with the phone booth and deliver the Humanis Donor List. This will net you
[_500 Y_] and a karma reward:


 (Karma Gained: 1)


 Head back to the hideout now and it is time to talk to everyone (which is
one of your favorite parts, right!? right!?). First up is Blitz, who will ask
you about runs for nuyen. You can get him to spill the reason behind his debt
if you ask (I choose to bring up loan sharks and thugs), and he'll tell you
about a girl named Emilie. You can encourage him to look for her some more,
which smells like a personal quest for me so BE SURE to do so.

 Talk to Dietrich next, who will talk about Alexander and the fact that he
is helping out at Samuel's. Interesting combo. He will also show you his new
power: he can summon a leyline thanks to the dragon. Very handy. After your
first talk, note that you can talk to him again about how he got into running
the shadows from a punk band. You will learn his motto in life here, and his
cycle of pleasing The Dragonslayer. Be SURE to ask him when this cycle will
end, which is a bit sad to hear but important for later.

 Next up is Eiger, who is cleaning her rifle. You can talk to her about her
time in the KSK if you wish, and she will answer most of your questions. One
of them has extra dialog with the [ETIQUETTE: SECURITY] option. She will tell
you all dialog options except for one: what happened to her team. Too sensitive
for now...

 Lastly we have Glory. After her thoughts on the run, ask her to keep telling
you her story, picking up from last time. Glory will hesitate a bit here, but
remind her that the last talk DID have an impact on her. This is enough to get
her talking again, so listen to her next chunk of the story. At the end, you
will have to be patient for the next part.


 OK, now that we are done talking to the team, go interact with the mission
computer. You should have two new emails here: one from Gunari Mettbach about
some shipments that were hijacked. The second email is from an unknown, and
tells you to meet an agent of theirs at the nearby coffee shop. Hmmm...

 Before leaving, head to the JOBS section and claim the payment for the
Humanis datasteal. This nets you a whopping [_3,750_], with the majority of
it going to Alice and some to your teammates. Next up, check out the pending
jobs to see "MKVI PROTOTYPE EXTRACTION". It seems Paul has found us a new job
for us. Go ahead and read about it and accept it. This will gives us a mission
item called [_LITTLE BLACK BOX_], which we'll use later.

 Lastly, post the "Humanis Safe House List" for sale on the Shadowland BBS.
We'll come for the pay on it later. Once you get off the computer, you will
get a few new objectives since we agreed to some things.


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to AG Chemie Europa

 o Objective: Meet with Gunari About the Missing Shipment


 OK, let's go talk to Paul now. He will share the small amount of info he
has found on the Harfeld Manor, which shows large amounts of money flowing
in. Well... good to know I guess. You also have a second DVD to watch, which
you can do so now but it is mainly notes on things, especially dragons. Still,
very interesting stuff.


 Time to go check in with some people around the neighborhood. First up, go
see the tech shop and talk to Maliit. Ask if she's got the drone fixed or not
and you'll get the [_FIXED DRONE_]. However, WE can't use it! Only the owner
can. Now, go talk to Blitz about the drone (it was in the hotel we found him
in after all) and he will admit it is HIS. He didn't bring it up at the time
though (which is bit of BS if you ask me), but you can give it back to him to
add it to his offensive capabilities. You may as well, especially since you
can't use it.


 OK, next up head south to the cafe and talk to Luca. He will proposition you
to... do certain tasks for his group (unnamed group) during certain missions,
which they can tell you at any time. It is sketchy at best, but go ahead and
except it, even agreeing to his trial run. This guide well show you what all
of your options are when the time comes, so don't worry to much about it.


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Take the U-Bahn to Frankfurter Tor


 Head outside now and make your way to Gunari (to the northwest). BEFORE you
talk to him though, note the sewer worker nearby. Go ahead and talk to him to
learn of his problem and, well... what happened to his partner. Nothing good!
Still, he offers you his job and pay, so take him up on his offer:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Resolve the Situation in the Sewers


 Let's talk to Gunari now and ask him about his missing shipments. Gunari
has tracked them to a nearby kiev and offers you a job and 500 Y to take out
the gang hijacking his weapons. We get an expanded inventory as well, so this
is a good job to take on. Ask Gunari about the gang as you wish and accept the
job.


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Take the U-Bahn to Gesundbrunnen Kiez


 OK, that is all of the people we HAVE to talk to. We found several more jobs
to do and have plenty of options on what to do next. We are going to do some
of these smaller jobs first though, before going on our next proper run. That
said, read the note below regarding the updated inventory and let's go onto
the next section already!


 (-NOTE-) There ARE new items in the shop's inventory, but before we go on
          and spend our money, I say we expand Gunari's inventory first. So
          the plan for now is to do this sewer job first, and then go on to
          Gunari's mission right after that... so expect the shop lists to
          make a return after we return from Gunari's mission! Plus, we'll
          have a little extra nuyen to spend. Sounds like a plan to me!


 With that note up above out of the way and outlining our action, let's do
this sewer job first since we are right here. Should be easy... right? Yeah,
sure...

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ A ghostly labyrinth of tunnels and dead-end passageways makes up the
    network of sewers beneath the Kreuzbasar. You climb down the ladder into
    this shallow underworld and reel at the wave of foul smells that washes
    over you, clogging your sinuses and saturating your clothing.

    As your eyes adjust to the light, you find yourself standing at the edge
    of a narrow channel of murky gray-green water. The rush of churning water
    echoes down the tunnel.

    You catch a flash of motion in your peripheral vision. Something man-sized,
    moving fast, flitting across the far end of the tunnel. You strain your
    eyes to see it, but to no avail. The thing - whatever it is - is gone.



 Well, here we are in the sewers under our kiev, being tasked to fix water
pumps with a MONSTER (or something) just stalking us in the shadows. I FEEL
IT LOOKING AT ME!


 o Objective: Fix the Water Pumps

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Locate the Missing Maintenance Worker


 Head forward and cross the bridge to the north, then hang a left. The room
here has some bones you can check out. Not a good sign. Continue to the left
and check out the two pump consoles. You will learn the south turbine is
clogged and all operations are rerouted to the central computer.

 Head back to the right, past the room and past the bridge to the right.
Before you go south, head into the nearby room (using the hole on the right)
and inspect the corpse. It is the maintenance worker. Poor bastard. Go ahead
and examine him to find a sewer manual. Flip to both of the colored bookmarks
here for the [_MAINTENANCE GUY'S CODE_] (which is "822896"), then pocket the
book for the  [_PUMP & TURBINE MAINTENANCE_].


 Head south now and inspect the corpse here for some flavor text, then go
and interact with the turbine here. If you have [DECKING: 4] here, you can
bypass the code but you can also just put in the code we got above to do
it as well ("822896"). Either way, power up the turbine. Note that the game
saves after you do...


 Head north now and you'll see... ghouls...


  Fight: A tasty little snack.
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Gah, feral ghouls. These things have 60 HP each and can disease you if they
hit you, which is -2 HP per round. Blah. They will take a couple of turns to
reach us though.

 Start the fight by getting Glory and whoever your second tank is (your MC
or drone... preferrably not Eiger) to block the upper bridge. You can use
this as a choke point, and then start shooting the ghouls as they come with
whoever you can. Start off with Eiger and her sniper rifle aiming for the
far-off ghoul while Dietrich casts haste on her. Soon the ghouls will clog
up the choke-point though, at which point you should put Eiger off to the
side and then  use Eiger's shotgun to hit multiple targets at a time.
Dietrich can buff people with Aim and even use Electro Core if the ghouls
are grouped up (the -AP is worth it).

 You will have three feral ghouls to start off with, but a fourth will come
in from the right on the second turn. Keep the bridge guarded and kill them
off one at a time to end this battle easily.

 Well fun. Let's head north now and continue all the way north through the
door. We are in the console room. Head up to the console and once you start
to approach it we'll get into another fight...


  Fight: Fighting for the console.
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 More ghouls. Great.

 This fight is actually a bit easier, mainly because our enemies are divided
up quite a bit. This fight will start out as we approach the console, with
two enemies coming at us from the left. There are also two feral ghouls
coming at us from the south, but they will take three turns to get to us at
the very least.

 Take out the two nearby feral ghouls first. Lay into both of them and kill
them off in two turns (have Dietrich focus on putting Aim on Eiger as her
shotgun will help a ton), then get ready for the enemies from the south. I
will note that there IS a summon shrine to the left, with a Typhoon spirit
that you can summon, but I really don't think it is needed here (you can take
out these two enemies easily enough).

 Soon two more feral ghouls will show up from the south, so since you will
be ready for them you can take them out easily and finish this fight off.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Now that the enemies are dead, we have a few things to do BEFORE interacting
with the console. Head to the upper left room and pick up the item here for
[_157 Y_]. Next check out the room to the south to find a [_HYPER_]. Go ahad
and interact with the console now. Turn on both pumps and you will get them
both running.


 Soon afterward, a ghoul will enter the room from above, asking you NOT to
shoot. Now... you can if you wish (see the optional "fight" below), but I
HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT. There is karma to be had here after all!

 AGAIN, SKIP THE FIGHT BELOW!

 Listen to the ghoul and he will tell you of a deal he used to have with
Monika and Dr. Ezkibel. The Dr. USED to send them body parts and in return
they used to keep the sewers running. Well guess who stopped doing his part
of the deal... Tell the ghoul that you will talk to the good doctor...


 o Objective: Leave the Sewers

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Call Dr. Ezkibel on the Nearby Commlink


  Fight (OPTIONAL): Fish in a barrel...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is... just sad.

 If you choose to, you can kill off the ghouls that have their minds. There
are four of them in total, but they each have 10 HP and pretty much no stats
so you are likely to have a 99% chance to hit. Just kill all four of them off
and you'll be done. You monster.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 OK, let's go talk to the doctor. There are NUMEROUS ways to do this, but
we're going to do the best one. After letting the doctor know who you are
(which gives him a pause), choose to tell him that you "caught him red-handed"
and then tell him that he is "going to keep his contract otherwise you will
tell the people of the Kreuzbasar". This won't go over well, but you will talk
him into continuing his contract without paying him anything.

 Once you are done, go talk to the ghoul leader to let him know the good news
and afterwards you will get the objective below (for some reason) as well as
karma gain below. Also, take note of the... note below in case you wanted to
spend money or something. Crazy...


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Decide What to do About the Ghouls

 (Karma Gained: 1)


 (-NOTE-) Instead of basically blackmailing the doctor, you can also either
          choose to make a deal with the doctor and ghouls which ends up
          making the ghouls do "dirty jobs" for the doctor (which they will
          hate and you won't get your karma reward) OR you can offer to pay
          for their food. This costs [1,000 Y] but if you have either the
          [ETIQUETTE: SOCIALITE] or [ETIQUETTE: SHADOWRUNNER], you can reduce
          that price to [600 Y].


 With all of that done, go ahead and exit the sewers now...


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The fresh-air of the Kreuzbasar is a welcome relief after your time in
    the sewers. A cool breeze drifts across the street, carrying with it the
    smells of food being prepared, cheap alcohol being poured, and fires
    being lit against the cold.

    The stench of the sewers, however, still lingers in your nose, a bad
    olfactory aftertaste. At least the pumps are working again - sewage
    overflowing into the streets would certainly smell far worse.


 Talk to the sewer worker here. Tell him about his friend and ask to be paid.
After that, be sure to give him the [ITEM: MAINTENANCE MANUAL] to give to his
family. You will get the karma reward below (broke into a 2 karma and a 1 karma
interval) and your [_500 Y_] reward.


 (Karma Gained: 3)


 (-NOTE-) You may wonder how your relations with Dr. Ezkibel are now, but you
          can go talk to him if you wish to get closure (you may as well). You
          get an awkward dialog choice here (embrace it!) and everything will
          be forgotten. Also, there is no price increase to his prices, which
          is very important!


 (-NOTE-) Your characters should have leveled up to LEVEL THREE, giving you
          a host of new options to choose from. Spend some time to level them
          all up before our next mission.


 (-NOTE-) The next mission benefits from CHARISMA: 3 greatly if you don't
          have it yet. It is worth a Steam Achievement and 1 Karma if you
          want to spend the karma...


 As we discussed at the end of Chapter 4, our next goal is to secure Gunari's
weapon shipment (in order to expand the inventory, so once you are ready, head
to the U-Bahn and select:


 "Travel to the Gesundbrunnen U-Bahn station to locate Gunari's missing
  shipments."


 Note that you can ONLY TAKE ONE ally along with you. Depending on your
specialty, you should choose someone who complements you. I am a decker/rigger
so I took along Eiger. Now, let's do it!

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ It is a short train ride to Gesundbrunnen. You exit the subway car,
    stepping onto the old, grungy platform. The place is deserted, though
    signs of life are everywhere. A gaping hole in the ceiling filters cool,
    hazy light in from above. To your right, a small plot of crops struggles
    to endure in the cold and the limited light of the station. Trash and
    junk litters the platform. It's clear this place hasn't had anything
    resembling a janitorial staff in quite some time.

    Somewhere in this old, run-down U-Bahn station lies the entrance to
    Gesundbrunnen kiez, and hopefully some leads on the whereabouts of the
    Rabengeister and Gunari's missing shipment.



 We'll get out primary objective out of the gate:


 o Objective: Locate the Missing Shipments


 You can check the garden up ahead if you wish as well as the doorway to the
north to see the stairs are collapsed in. Head inward and you'll see two Ork
guards guarding the way in.

 Once you get near them they will halt you and ask what you are doing here
(NOTE: They will usually address whoever is closest to them - they actually
talked to MY DRONE on my first time through). Here you can tell the truth or
lie, including a [CHARISMA: 4] option. Past that you have a [CHARISMA: 3]
dialog option. If you can't lie your way in, you can either pass a
[STRENGTH: 5] option or bribe them for [100 Y]. Or you could always just
attack them (see below).


  Fight (OPTIONAL): Like YOU can stop us...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 If push comes to shove, you can FORCE your way in. You will have to take
out the two Ork guards though. Not very hard to do, especially since you get
the first move here. Still, a bit rougher with only two team members. Take
them on one at a time and use the cover here to win easily.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Head downstairs however way you can.

 Once you head north, you will see Quorin. He's more than happy to talk to
us. Ask him about the market and then ask him about the Rabengeister. Finally
ask about the shipments. He's no help with anything here, but will tell you
how the station has been going down the tubes. You can offer to help here and
Quorin will tell you about "Schinderhannes". This gives you an option to ask
about Robin Hood if you have [INTELLIGENCE: 3], but it is just extra dialog.
To the left you can examine a dresser if you wish and to the right you can
check out the bar. You can chat to a girl named Goldfish here, who is doing
a European Tour from the California Free State, which is interesting but soon
we'll be cut off from the bar.

 Head north and examine the rubbish pile and ladder if you want. Nothing to
note. Keep going north and you will see some vendors. Talk to the middle one
if you want to see his arms selection (it isn't worth the time, to be quite
honest, but here it is):

gun with an [INTELLIGENCE: 3]. he is very much trying to be a good business man
but it isn't working out very well is it? Heh. To the right, you can check out

 Like last time, you can comment on some of his goods with a [BIOTECH: 3]
check. You can also see the crate by his stall is one of Gunari's. Hmm...

 Head to the left now. You can talk to the militia if you want, but enter the
room behind them. Here there are SEVERAL things we can do. For the purposes of
this guide, we are going to split this up into HOSTILE and NON-HOSTILE options.
For the record, going NON-HOSTILE is BY FAR the best way, but does require you
to have [CHARISMA: 3] to finish it. Let's go over both routes below.



   ~ HOSTILE ROUTE ~

 In this room, check out the info kiosk, which has some information options.
Note the number "6" option, which gives us a field to put in a password. Now,
note the scruffs by the door. You can follow these to the nearby wall, and if
you have [STRENGTH: 4] or if your teammate has it, you can move the wall to
find a ladder leading further down into the station. Eiger or Glory will have
no problem doing this at all.


 OR... you can use the password "Schinderhannes" in the info kiosk to open up
the door. This was given to you by that Quorin guy, and is very much a shot
in the dark.


 OR... you can go talk to the nearby militia leader and ask about the scruff
marks. She will try to change the subject, but when you point it out she will
hold you up. From here, you can choose to go with her (which is the non-hostile
route) or you can attack:


 (-NOTE-) DO NOT let them take you to their leader if you plan to be hostile,
          as it will be five enemies vs. one. Just... a very bad idea that we
          aren't even covering here...



  Fight (OPTIONAL): You really shouldn't have pointed that at us...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Now this fight can be a bit rough. Three vs. two and the enemy gets the
first move. This is especially tough if your MC is soft (Decker/Rigger) and
gets focused on. Get the soft targets in cover right away and focus on one
enemy at a time. They don't have a ton of health, so one should go down per
round fairly easily. Still, you may have to use a medkit here if you have a
soft main character.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 If you DID fight the militia members, they will drop a [_SCRAP OF PAPER_].
Go ahead and read it to see the password "Schinderhannes", which you can put
into the info kiosk to open the door.

 Whether or not you fight the militia or just head to the basement, head down
there now. You will end up seeing the leader: Quorin. This can go a few
different ways: if you DID NOT fight the militia you can still go non-hostile
but this is the hostile route guide after all. Go ahead and attack:


  Fight (OPTIONAL): You really shouldn't have stole from us...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight is easier than the previous one, as there are only two enemies
to fight. Quorin has 60 HP and is the leader, but his militia member is just
like our other targets and can be taken out first to make this a two vs. one
fight. Kill the militia member as Quorin takes cover to the left, then flush
him out (I just had Eiger snipe him) and the fight will be over.

 Once the fight is over, Quorin will drop [_QUORIN'S KEYS_]. Pick them up and
head down to the right hallway. Open the door down here and in the back use
the computer. You will see a list of all of his stolen items, which includes
the Gunari crate, which is in a locker at Frankfurter Tor (Number 49). You
will automatically send the info to Gunari and will be done here.


 o Return to the Kreuzbasar


 Head back to the U-Bahn now and return to the Kreuzbasar. None of the militia
guards will harass you on the way out, as they don't know what we've done. Heh.
That's all for the (non-preferred) "Hostile Route".



   ~ NON-HOSTILE ROUTE ~


 This path is BY FAR the best to take. Like the hostile route, there are
multiple ways to get to the gang leader.

 The easiest way to get there of course is to note the scruffs by the door.
You can follow these to the nearby wall, and if you have [STRENGTH: 4] or if
your teammate has it, you can move the wall to find a ladder leading further
down into the station. Eiger or Glory will have no problem doing this at all.


 OR... you can use the password "Schinderhannes" in the info kiosk to open up
the door. This was given to you by that Quorin guy, and is very much a shot
in the dark.


 OR... you can go talk to the nearby militia leader and ask about the scruff
marks. She will try to change the subject, but when you point it out she will
hold you up. From here, you can choose to go with her, which results in her
taking you to the basement headquarters as promises and seeing Quorin.


 Out of all of these options, I'd go with the scruffs by the door, as it is
just the easiest to do.


 Once you get to Quorin, choose to tell him that his hideout wasn't
particularly well-hidden, which makes him chuckle. Follow up with saying that
you are indeed here for a stolen crate. He will point out that his kiev isn't
doing so well and refuses to give it back. Now here, if you have [CHARISMA: 3]
you can state that you two SHOULD be working together. Next you can either
tell Quorin that you will hook them up with rations OR if you have [DECKING: 3]
you can offer your communications network instead. Either way, you will be able
to cut a deal. It's good to have friends.


 (-NOTE-) If you get through this mission WITHOUT attacking the Rabengeister
          Gang, you will get the "Doesn't Have To Be This Way" Steam
          Achievement. Congrats!


 o Return to the Kreuzbasar


 We're not quite done yet though: after making the deal, go talk to the
militia member and ACCEPT the beer they offer you for a [_COLD ONE_]. DO NOT
drink it right now.

 Head back up through the market area and up to the U-Bahn platform where
the guards are. Go talk to the Ork guard here and give him the beer you got
from downstairs for a small karma reward:


 (Karma Gained: 1)


 Head back to the U-Bahn now and head back to the Kreuzbasar.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You emerge from the U-Bahn station and out onto the familiar streets of
    the Kreuzbasar. The energy here is a stark contrast to the weary, slowly
    drowning mood of Gesundbrunnen. The Kreuzberg is an island of hope, afloat
    still amidst the dangerous currents of the Flux State. But it wouldn't
    take much for it to capsize.

    It's time to find Gunari and tell him the news.


 Once you get back you will get the objective below and a karma reward:


 o Objective: Return to Gunari for Your Payment

 (Karma Gained: 4)


 Go talk to Gunari now and tell him the good news for your [_500 Y_] reward.
He also mentions that he has an expanded inventory. We're going to go over
all the new inventory in the boxes down below though, but I want to point out
some other things we can do first. Let's start by heading back to your
hideout.


 In here head to your mission computer (like after the Sewer mission, there
is no point in talking to your teammates here: they all don't have anything
to say as the sewers and this run weren't considered to be "real runs"). On
your computer, check your messages (you should have 3). After that, check the
BBS to see your Humanis data has sold, which should net you [_414 Y_]. Leave
the computer now for your new objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Meet with Dr. Ezkibel


 We may as well go speak with the doctor. Head over to the Triage and talk
to him and he'll tell you he's got a job for us. This EVEN AFTER the sewers
thing. Wow. Still, go ahead and agree with it to learn he's got some inventory
sitting in a locked-down warehouse he wants us to retrieve. Should be a good
job, but he can't pay us in nuyen, but he will expand his shop. Bah, go ahead
and agree to do the job though.


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Take the U-Bahn to Adenauerplatz


 OK, now that we've done that, let's go over all the new tech and gear to be
found in the kiev:



 (-NOTE-) As before, we're about to run down the inventory of the local shops
          down below. Be warned: there are a LOT of shop blocks here. Just
          scroll past them all if you don't want to buy anything.

          Chances are that you can find SOMETHING here worth buying though.
          I personally had about 6,800 Y at this point.


 (-NOTE-) We are only covering NEW ITEMS in these boxes down below...

 OK, that is it with the lists!


 Now, we have to pick out our next mission. I'm going to go with the mission
we got from Luca Duerr, since it's been sitting for awhile. Head to the U-Bahn
platform now and choose:


 "Travel to Frankfurter Tor to meet Luca Duerr's team."


 Time to go see if we make the cut or not...

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ As the U-Bahn hums toward the Frankfurter Tor, you tug idly at the
    fabric of your maintenance uniform. You found it in a duffel bag on your
    seat when you boarded, along with a note from Duerr to put it on before
    your arrival.

    "The moment you step off this train," the note said, "your trial run
    begins. You are to rendezvous with the rest of your team, reconnoiter the
    building, and plant the specified devices in Aleshire's suite. Beyond that,
    your approach will be left to you.

    "Do not disappoint us. You are being watched."


 As you get off the U-Bahn, you will be met by a guard. Play it cool here
and don't bring up the mission. He knows all about us and the other three
"maintenance workers", so we are free to go.

 Head forward and you'll meet Jana, a female dwarf who is part of our team.
Ask her about our other team members, and you'll learn they went in ahead
already. Great. Jana turns out to not be a shadowrunner, and is actually a
real electrician. Well then. Great...

 Tell her you'll try to keep her safe and head forward. Head north at the
entrance and to the upper right you'll find a waitress. You can talk to her
for soycaf, although if you have [ETIQUETTE: STREET] or [CHARISMA: 3] you
can look at her secret stash of Jolt drugs:

 This will help later if you buy one. Go ahead and buy ONE, as we'll make our
money back and it will come in later. South of the building you can inspect a
fire escape ladder, but it is out of reach. Head inside the building now.

 You will meet our *CHARMING* team-mates here. This team just screams of
"unprofessional", but we got a job to do. Talk to them however you want and
soon we'll have our objectives:


 o Objective: 1. Get Jana to the Utility Room

 o Objective: 2. Get the Team Upstairs to Disable Penthouse Security

 o Objective: 3. Have James Hide the Cameras in the Penthouse


 Let's start out by talking to the Stressed Suit pacing just to the left of
us. He will stop to talk but looks down on us. If you have [CHRISMA: 3] or
the [ETIQUETTE: CORPORATE] skill, you can get him to calm down. He'll share
why he is freaking out, so give him the [JOLT] item and he'll end up giving
you the [_SUIT'S DOOR CODE_] (which is 53786) and promise a credstick for you
later.


 To the south, you can find the guard security post. We have nothing to do
here though, so don't bother. To the upper right, there is a clothing store
you can shop at:

        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 The other thing of note in here is an electrical grid. Once you interact
with it, Jana will tell you she can rig it to shock the guard to the north if
we want, which we'll do in a bit.


 Back out in the lobby, you can visit one last shop to the upper left. This
is a tech shop. You can talk to the parents in here and learn about CHILD
tech pieces for a head-up in school if you want and put in your two cents.

 You can also buy the "Encephalon Next" from the sales woman here:

 If you are interested in this item (for the INT +2), go ahead and buy it and
send it to the TRIAGE Clinic. Be mindful though that the doctor is going to
charge 5,000 Y to install it for you.

 If you do buy it, you get the [_ENCEPHALON NEXT PURCHASE ORDER_] to show the
doctor later.


 OK, time to get to the utility panel, which is being guarded by the guard
to the north. You CAN go talk to him, but he's not going to let your through
since your clearance is not valid. Do note that there are [CHARISMA: 3] and
[ETIQUETTE: SECURITY] dialog options.


 NOTE: I haven't personally verified this, but wanted to share this tip
       from a reader, Sean, about the Security Etiquette:

       Hey, I'm playing the game right now and just wanted to give you an
       update on the quest Trial Run.  If you have the Security Etiquette
       you can as the guard by the panel for the updated protocols. Then
       you can talk to the guard in the guard room and use the new protocols
       and get him to leave, when he does you can use the computer there to
       set off alarms away from your target then use the panel to kill both
       guards and continue as normal.  If you do, then you only have to fight
       your teammate and not security!


 So we have two options: take out the guards or shock one. Shocking one is
easy: just go to the clothing shop and have Jana do her thing on the panel.
Bam, guard taken care of. You can also fight the guards by going to the
security office and choosing to attack.

 It is a simple fight with only two guards and the ability to attack first,
so it is HIGHLY recommended you just shock the guards.

 Either way, you can pick up the [_THETA KEY CARD_] from the guard's body
and then access the utility room. Have Jana do her thing and she'll open up
the elevator in mere seconds, fulfilling our first objective. Whee. Go ahead
and head to the elevator now and move on to the residence area.


  RESIDENCES
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Jana will stop us here and give us the combo to room 303 - "14291". Let's
hope it is good still! She also tells us the penthouse code will be set to
"11111". The team will ruffle each others feathers some more but after that
we'll get some mission items (the codes Jana just told us): [_APARTMENT 303
CODE_] and the [_PENTHOUSE MAINTENANCE CODE_].

 Head forward to the path split (my, these are posh hallways!). Head left
first (right leads to the penthouse) and you'll see some apartments. Apt.
301 and 302. Apartment 301 is the suit's place, that we helped out earlier,
so you can head to the keypad and enter the code ("53786") to get inside. You
will find [_200 Y_] here (which covers our jolt cost and then some) and a fire
escape exit. Good to know.


 Head outside and to the upper right. Apartment 303 is up here but so is a
door in a cubby. Head to it and if you have [CYBERDECK AND DECKING: 4] you can
tether into the system.


 o NET INFILTRATION: FRANKFURTER TOR APARTMENT
 |
 |
 |  This matrix run is pretty short. Head inward and go right when you can.
 | You will run into a room with three White IC. Take them out one at a time
 | and move right to find the "Utility Hatch" console. This thing gives us an
 | exit later, which is handy as an "immediate exit" but not necessary.
 |
 |  Head back to the previous room now and head north. There are two consoles
 | up here guarded by two White IC an two "Sparkly White" IC, which are a bit
 | tougher. Still, with the Killer Program and two basic attacks you should be
 | able to kill a sparkle IC in one turn, so focus on them and then take out
 | the White IC. You can use the consoles here now to open APT 301 & 302 once
 | they are dead.
 |
 |  And that's it for this short matrix section. Head back and jack out.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 Next up is Apt. 302. Now, if you couldn't open it up with the matrix section
above, there IS a code you can use to open the door:


 777 SELF NOTE: The code here is 38297. I have NO IDEA where you get this
                code. If you happen to know, let me know. Also, if you can't
                do [DECKING: 4], there is no point in getting in here. Thanks
                to the Steam Forum for this door code!


 Inside of Apt. 302 you can find a terminal that you can deck into if you
have [DECKING: 4]. No Matrix area, but you do get the key paydata item:
[_PAYDATA: ROMANTIC RECORDING_]. Not bad!


 Next up, let's head right to Apt. 303. We got the code from Jana earlier
for this one, so put it in (it is "14291") and head inside.


 (-NOTE-) FYI: This is the TIME TO SAVE, as we have a choice coming up!


 The only thing in here is a painting, so go ahead and interact with it
to advance the story. Jana will do her install, freeing up the poor elf as
even more drama unfolds. We really have no idea what we are really doing
here, but the mage let's us know we are working for someone called "The Lodge".

 Our talk is interrupted by a man entering his apartment. Crap. The same guy
from the store downstairs. You can try to talk him down here OR you can just
let James attack him. HOWEVER - there is an IMPORTANT CHOICE here: the ELF
WILL BETRAY THE TEAM and attack. He obviously hates "The Lodge", and you can
either CHOOSE TO JOIN HIM or SUPPORT THE RUN.


 ~ OPTION: CHOOSE TO JOIN THE ELF: ~

 This is so important that I want to point it out: Joining the ELF means that
you make an enemy of James and scrap the run. More importantly, you will no
longer get any work from "The Lodge".

 Needless to say, I am completing the job so I can give you the most options
out of this guide. However, your morals or character personality may NOT do
this job. You miss out on some options later, but nothing you can't live
without.


 ~ OPTION: CHOOSE TO WORK WITH THE LODGE: ~

 You will have to put down the Elf. You will continue on with the mission
though and dubious acts or not you will get further work options. This is
the choice I'm making for the guide.


  Fight: Make it to the Penthouse!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Our first target is the elf. Let Jana take care of him on her own. She has
the shocker weapon (Defiance Super Shocker), so taze the elf (use AIM) and
that will stun-lock him. Be sure to re-load and then spend your next turns
shooting him with your weapon. Jana can take care of him all by herself.

 Your main character and James will be handling security, and they ARE
coming. You'll be fighting a total of SEVEN enemies with just the two of
you (with Jana coming soon). Outside is a Captain and three guards. James
can help with Aim and various magic (Acid Stream is pretty good), but your
main character is likely stronger unless you are a pure Face or Decker
character. Use the planter outside the door for cover and take on the
security, but don't group up. Once Jana does join in you can use her to
stun-lock someone (that is literally her best attribute).

 Once the first four enemies are dead, you have a breather but you'll note
the battle isn't over. We need to get to the penthouse. However, in the
hallway leading to the penthouse there are three more enemies: two guards
and a mage. If you are lucky enough to have 3 AP on someone (like my drones,
for example) you can round the corner with 1 AP, shoot, and retreat. Hehehe...

 Take the last three enemies out, focusing on the mage if you can, but
killing off enemies first and foremost. Once they are dead, this fight will
be over.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Now that we are free, head to the Penthouse and input the code (which is
going to be "11111") and enter. You can find an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] in here.
Go ahead and interact with the three objective points and talk to James
however you wish (I chose not to lose my cool). Soon you'll be done and will
be told to get to the U-Bahn.


 o Objective: Board the U-Bahn


 Now, we have a few ways to do this. If you unlocked the Utility Hatch
earlier, we can skip right to the U-Bahn, which ends the mission. Very
nice, right!?


 If you didn't, we have one more fight. Head to the fire escape and go down
to transition to the outside and our final fight:


  Fight (OPTIONAL?): Last bit of resistance
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 We start out on the left side of the building, but we are already in combat
mode. However, the enemy is over in the garden area to the right, across from
the street and building so it will take a couple turns to get over there.

 Once you do get over there, there will be three enemies: one up front (Jana
can stun lock him easily), one off to the left side and finally one off to
the right side. Let Jana stun-lock one and take out the back enemy of your
choice.

 Once you get back there, a fourth enemy will appear from the right (where
the U-Bahn area is). This enemy is a grenadier, so watch your spacing and
wipe out the other side guard and this grenadier, then follow up with Jana's
stun-locked enemy to end the fight and clear the way to the U-Bahn so we
can go home.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once you are at the U-Bahn, you will call Luca. He will comment on the run
and a bit of what he learned out of you and expected, telling you to put in
a code he gives you. Watch what happens once you do...


 Head back home now and you will get various story wrap-ups depending on
what you did:



 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your return trip to the Kreuzbasar is a quiet one - the train from the
    Frankfurter Tor is empty, save for you. There's nothing to distract you
    from your thoughts.

    You're finished with the first part of your "audition." Luca Duerr is
    waiting at Cafe Cezve to administer the second.


 (OPTIONAL) STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your return trip to the Kreuzbasar is a lonely one.

    You spend the ride in quiet contemplation. The bugs that you were meant
    to plant in Aleshire's penthouse rattle in your pocket; a cheerful sound,
    and an intangible reminder of your decision to scrub the run.

    Your audition is over. The Lodge - whoever they are - are going to have
    to find themselves another shadowrunner.



 Once you get home, you'll get a small karma reward and an objective:


(Karma Gained: 2)

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Notify Luca Duerr That His Task is Complete


 Time to go report in to Luca. Here you have another choice: CONTINUE to work
for him and "The Lodge" or go your own way. Clearly your choice, but like I
explained up above I'll go through their job options once they come in. Still,
you aren't missing much, so go with your gut and/or integrity. You do get paid
for the run though: [_1,500 Y_].


 And that's end for that mission, now to decide what we're going to do next!


 (-NOTE-) Your teammates should have leveled up to LEVEL 4 at this point, so
          be sure to increase their stats and abilities when you get a chance!


 Next up, head to the hideout. We have paydata to put up for sale. You can
also talk to Blitz about "The Lodge" if you wish, but we don't learn much. You
also don't need to talk to anyone else, as they have nothing to say (our last
run wasn't a "REAL" run after all). So go ahead and sell the "Romantic Feelings"
paydata on the BBS. We'll get the money later.


 You can also go visit the TRIAGE Clinic with the  [_ENCEPHALON NEXT PURCHASE
ORDER_] and get it added to the shop list. It costs 5,000 Y though, so you
likely can't afford it yet. I'll list it in the next shop update, which is
going to be soon for the TRIAGE Clinic since we're doing that optional mission
for them next.


 With that said, head to the U-Bahn platform for our next mission. We are
going to do the final optional task we have for now, so interact with the
train and pick:


 "Assemble the team and travel to the Adenauerplatz Station to find Ezkibel's
  Lab."


 (-NOTE-) Be SURE to bring along a Decker for this mission. Or a drone. One
          of the two.

        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The ride to the Adenauerplatz is a dismal one. Your only company on the
    train is an elderly dwarf in a ragged peacoat, and he spends most of his
    time muttering to himself. When the train rattles to a stop, he slowly
    rises from his perch and begins to hobble toward the doorway.

    The station itself isn't much different: an old, broken-down thing at
    the end of its useful life, feebly tottering toward obsolescence. This
    area of Berlin has clearly seen better days.

    A window of light shines down from the surface, and even that looks stale.
    Slowly, you begin to climb.


 o Objective: Gain Entry into the Lab


 Time to go get Ezkibel's goods, I suppose. The bioscience building has a
VERY large parking lot. Looks like a good place for a shootout. Heh... there
are some people hanging out to the left, but we can't interact with them.

 Head to the door and note that if you have [STRENGTH: 4] or [STRENGTH: 6]
you can interact with it (by pounding or trying to force the hydraulics).
You can also have your muscle (Eiger) try it out, but nothing will happen.

 Next you can check the tires nearby to move them and uncover a vent. Here
you can use a [DRONE] or [SELF: DWARF] to enter the vents, where you can
find a bundle of wires. You can short out the front door wires here to open
the front door and get into the lab.

 If you can't do that, head to the left and use your Decker to jack-in to
the data entry point you find. We'll force the door open.


 o NET INFILTRATION: SUTTERLIN BIOSCIENCE
 |
 |
 |  Another short Matrix run. This one only technically has two screens, but
 | is split into two parts thanks to some pathway blocks. Kill the first two
 | White IC in the first are, but DO NOT engage the upper enemies (the game
 | may get stuck here if you do). Instead, head right and enter the door to
 | get up there naturally.
 |
 |  Here you will face a Sparkly IC, another White IC and a support IC. Take
 | out the support first as it shields and buffs its comrades and we can do
 | without that. Use Blaster if you have it, as it can help a ton here (I
 | also like to put Erosion on an enemy close to death so they die naturally
 | in time). Once they are dead, interact with the console to gain entry into
 | the building.
 |
 |  And that's it for this short matrix section. Head back and jack out.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 With that done, enter the bioscience building to continue and get a new
objective:


 o Objective: Locate the Experimental Bioware


 You can enter the right door to see an observation terminal, detailing some
Hellhound and Basilisk experiments. That Basilisk sounds NASTY. The door
further in leads to a wide area. The right door from the entryway also has
a terminal you can read some interesting things on, mostly relating to what
this facility was used for. The door also leads to the wide area.

 This wide area has a TON of things to look out. Three key card readers and
a ladder leading down into the facility. Two of the key card readers we can't
interact with: the two to the north (the Executive Panel and Clearance B panel
namely). You CAN interact with the one on the left if you have [DECKING: 5],
if you are able. Do so and you will be in a fight...


  Fight: Fighting the Peasants
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is a rather easy fight against three drones, so we won't go over it
too much. You can haste Eiger and put her up near the nearby desk, using her
enhanced AP and shotgun to likely take out a drone in the process. Follow
that up with your main character and Glory as backup to clean-up whoever is
left.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once the fight is done, head to the left and you'll meet a disheveled man
who bursts out of a nearby room. This man is Philip Rex and is GREATLY
disturbed... and pissed off that you killed his "peasants". Yeah...

 Now, you CAN choose to kill him off if you want, but I'd rather talk to
him (plus, he is just... hilarious). If you play along with him by saying
you got off on "the wrong foot" and then telling him that you are "on a quest",
you can recruit Philip into helping you, which ends up netting you the key
item [_KEYCARD B_].

 Once you have that, you can talk to him some more to learn what happened.
I love the fact that he is semi-there and tells you about the sewer area where
Billy is. Billy sounds like he will be a hell of a fight as well. Sheesh...

 When you are done talking, you can visit the room Philip came out of to read
through his security log. You can also learn of his... quirky disposition here
by the show "Knight-Kings of Lightninghold". Heh. Also, the room southeast of
where Philip came out of can be entered to find [_48 NUYEN_]. The room to the
northeast has another ladder leading downward.


 So... now we have two ladders to take and a keycard to try out. Head to the
main area and use Keycard B on the far right keypad. Inside you can find...
yet ANOTHER ladder. Heh. But there is also an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] to pick up.
Do so and head down the ladder. This leads to a self-contained room with a
safe you can use the keycard on to pick up the [_AUTO-INJECTOR: BLISS_] item.
Not a bad find.

 Head back up now and enter the middle area ladder (this one and the one to
the north lead to the same area, really). You'll be back down into the sewers
here, but head to the lower right corner where you can find [_48 NUYEN_]. Head
back to the north now and to the upper left. You will see another locked door,
and you KNOW Billy is going to be behind it. Get ready before opening it, as
we will be in another fight:


  Fight: Billy's Reign is Over
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Now this can be an annoying fight. Billy is a badass of course, but at
the start of the fight we don't get to see him. Instead, we get two Hellhounds
coming from the left and right. Start to take them down one at a time but get
someone like Glory ready to stand in the doorway on the right, as Billy will
join in soon.

 After a couple turns, a third Hellhound will come in from the south, so be
ready for him. Despite Billy being the big threat, focus on taking down the
Hellhounds while sicking Glory right up against Billy to try and get his
attention (which may or may not work). Billy hits harder than most enemies of
course, and has 100 HP to top that, but his most annoying ability has to be
the fact that he can petrify a party member, taking them out of the fight for
a number of turns. After about three turns, your party member will return to
the fight but it is still very annoying (he got my rigger and took two of my
drones down... ugh!). Glory is particularly adept against Billy with her armor
shredding moves, so make the most of her in this fight.

 Still, focus on the Hellhounds and follow up on Billy and you'll be OK.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once Billy is dead, examine his corpse for the [_EXECUTIVE KEYCARD_]. Just
what we were looking for. Head back to the upper floor and talk to Philip now
where you will get two [KEYCARD 3] talking options. For now, just say "Nope"
and then your character will mention the "Knight-Kings of Lightninghold" show,
saying that there are SEVEN episodes in total, not six (note that this
requires your character having checked Philip's security console). This gives
you a [DECKING: 4], which lets Philip agree to un-doing the quarantine.


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Use a Terminal to Disengage the Quarantine


 OK, we got two things to do now, both of which will make Philip very, VERY
happy. First, enter the Executive Room with your new keycard. This makes
Philip stop and praise us, running to the snacks. You can talk to him for
more praise, but in the back here is the [_EXPERIMENTAL BIOWARE SAMPLES_] we
came here for, giving us another objective:

 o Objective: Return to the Kreuzbasar


 Lastly, let's make Philip's day by getting that last episode for him. Head
to a terminal (one of the two near the start of the lab works) and if you
have [DECKING: 4], you can hack into the network and download the final show
for him, sending it to his computer and lifting the quarantine.


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Tell Philip the Quarantine is Over

 (KARMA GAINED: 1)


 Go talk to Philip now and he will be overjoyed, running over to his console
to enjoy the show (which he thinks is GREAT, despite its reception in the rest
of the world). You get a karma reward too, which is awesome, even if it is
just a little.


 Time to make our way back home, but as soon as you step out of the building
we will be in a fight. Because of course we will.


  Fight: Shiawase Appears!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Remember when I said the parking lot area looks like a good place for a
shoot out. Well, here we are! The Shiawase company has tracked us down after
we entered the building, claiming we are stealing their patents. Well... yeah,
maybe a bit...

 Hilariously enough, if you have made friends with Philip (which you should
have), he will come to your aid here, claiming that he is defending his lands
in the process! Ha! He will unleash four drones to help us out: three hover
drones and a grenade launching drone. Such a thing of beauty...


 The AI will go first, which helps a ton but let's talk about the enemies
really quick. There are six in total, with a Grenadier and Conjurer on the
lower left side and a Mage and Technician in the middle, with two soldiers
helping them out. The enemy will largely get into cover before you get a
turn, with the stray shot being fired here and there.

 Once your turn comes around, depending on what the AI did you may have an
easy kill or two lined up. The Mage is annoying and will buff enemies but
other than him your main targets should be the Grenadier and Conjurer. I
tend to send a buffed Glory after them with her Adrenal Pump to quickly take
care of the Conjurer (who tends to wait a few turns before summoning a fire
spirit). Eiger can help clean up front with her shotgun while Dietrich helps
buff and heal.

 With your AI helpers, this will be a rather easy fight. Go for the priority
targets and kill off whoever you can and soon this 8 vs. 6 battle will be
over.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 We will have one last conversation with Philip and then we are free to head
back to the U-Bahn.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The U-Bahn trip back from the Adenauerplatz is a shaky one.
    Surprisingly, the train is packed - the only empty seats are at the
    very back of the car.

    A haggard-looking young mother marches down the aisle, dragging her
    three screaming children behind her. Two boys and a girl, each around
    six years old, As the woman nears you, her eyes fix on the frozen pouches
    of bio-engineered meat what you liberated from Sutterlin's executive
    freezer.

    She opens her mouth to say something, but at that moment, the little
    girl jams a finger into her brother's nose. The boy howls, and the young
    mother's shoulder's slump. Slowly, robotically, she turns back toward her
    destination and begins to trundle forward, dragging her squalling
    offspring forward with the solemnity of a funeral procession.

    Eventually, the train hums to a stop. You debark gratefully, lugging a
    freezer's worth of bioware samples behind you.


 As you come back home, you will of course be reminded of your objectives
once again but you'll also get another slight karma reward:


(KARMA GAINED: 2)

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Return the Bioware Samples to Dr. Ezkibel


 Very good. Let's head to the TRIAGE Cyberclinic now to let Ezkibel know the
good news. You can also give him the [_SCHEMATIC: AUTO-INJECTOR (BLISS)_] we
found to add to his inventory. Speaking of inventory, he has a LOT of new
items thanks to that run we just went on. Check it out:

        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Quite the list, right? Well, start saving if you want anything: a lot of
this stuff is VERY expensive.


 As we did a "quick mission" once again, note that you DO NOT have any
companion conversations back at headquarters. You CAN go check out the mission
computer though for the Shadowland Payday for our "Romantic Recording" that we
put up earlier. That will net you [_378 Y_]. The only other thing you can
really do at this point is go see Simmy. She's sporting a shiner but won't
talk about it. Lucky Strike may also have some dialog if you haven't talked
to her in awhile.


 You can go shop or whatnot if you wish, but it is time for our next PROPER
job (and not just some side-quest). It has been awhile since we've done a
proper job! Heh. Head to the U-Bahn and select:



  "Assemble the team and travel to the Pharma Laboratory Complex to eliminate
   the loose ends from your client's botched run."


 And with that we are off on our next mission.

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your client has hired you to "tie up loose ends" at a site of a botched
    cloak-and-dagger operation. One of the operatives from the failed mission
    has been captured by Knight Errant security forces, and it's only a
    matter of time before he talks.

    Your job is simple: kick in the door, find the operative, and put a
    bullet in his guts before he can spill them.


 o Objective: Find the Rigger

 o Objective: Kill the Rigger


 Well, at least we have a very uncomplicated objective. Find and kill the
loose end. At the start of this mission we are in combat mode though, and
we will be in for a LONG fight as we bust into the facility. The good
thing is that we have the first move. Let's go through this fight below:


  Fight: Storming the Pharmacy.
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As I mentioned earlier, we have time to prepare before we really get into
this fight. Now, you may be tempted to line up Eiger with the sniper rifle but
the room ahead isn't conducive to that, so switch to the shotgun and get ready
at the door with Glory and whoever else is going to rush in. Spend a turn or
two even with Dietrich, buffing up Eiger and Glory's aim and then hasting
Eiger, then open the door and rush in to see two guards on the left-hand side.
You will take them by surprise and likely kill one of both of them in a single
turn.

 The next turn will have two more guards come in, as you stay in fight mode
after taking out the first two (we are going to be in fight mode for awhile,
like I mentioned earlier). You still outnumber them by quite a bit, so
continue the close-range onslaught, taking out at least one per turn until
they are both dead.


 Now from here we are STILL in fight mode. Up ahead are a few rooms with closed
doors. Leave them closed for now, but note the drone port to the right. The
room to the north has four enemies in it that will STAY where they are, ready
to shoot at us as soon as we enter. The left door leads to a small room but two
enemies will come from that direction if given enough turns. More importantly...
there is a computer in this room that a Decker can jack into. It isn't NECESSARY
to do so, as the only thing in this maxtrix section is a camera control, but
that does help for seeing what is ahead in the next room and planning your
attack. You can do the same thing by putting a drone in the vent though, of you
can just read here what you are facing. Either way, note that this maxtrix
section is listed BELOW the battle box and check it out if you need to (it is
honestly very straight-forward).


 If you jack into the maxtrix, you will eventually spend enough turns that the
enemies on the left will attack you, but if you don't go into the left room and
rush them. There's only two soldiers here so you can take them out with close
range assault in a couple turns easily.

 Now... ready to storm the main room? Good. There are four enemies: a captain
and a mage in the back (which will take 2-3 turns to run up to if you are melee)
and two standard guards on the left who are much closer. Every single one of
them is already in cover as well. If you can, sending a drone through the port
on the right ahead of time for a back attack is very helpful, but either way
you still have time to buff your characters up before breaching the room, which
means Eiger and Glory at least should get Aim with one of them hasted (and
Glory with her Adrenaline Shot). Eiger should bust out the Sniper Rifle at the
doorway (not too far back) while Glory either rushes the mage or takes on one
of the left guards. Take out the mage first once you can, then focus on taking
out the guards one at a time (whoever you can - just to thin their numbers). I
recommend keeping Eiger in the back (south) part of the room if you've focused
on Sniper with her, as she can have full sweep of the room.

 Once the enemies are dealt with we STILL won't be done. Two more guards will
enter in from the left. Now, to really help yourself with this last portion of
fighting, get Dietrich up north where you can find a spirit shrine. You can
summon the Apocalypse Spirit here, which has the same attacks you've seen
before (still, I very much like the acid spit attack). This will be handy for
the two guards from the left but you can still overpower them fairly easily,
especially with back-up sniping from Eiger. The fight STILL isn't over once
those guards die though, as two MORE guards from the north show up. Eiger should
be able to greatly wound them and your summon helps out quite a bit here, but be
sure to release him once they are almost dead as these are the last enemies
we'll face in this portion. Once those two enemies from the north are dead, we
are finally given a break in the action. Sheesh!

 o NET INFILTRATION: PHARMA-JOB FOYER
 |
 |
 |  As I mentioned before, this Matrix Run is rather short and not necessary
 | in the slightest. The only reason you'd really do this is to get a visual
 | on the enemies coming up ahead in the northern room. Still, if you have a
 | good hacker you may as well put them to use!
 |
 |  The first area in this section has two White IC to put down, which
 | shouldn't put up much of a challenge to you at this point (burn them one
 | at a time). Moving on to the next area you will see an area in the middle
 | that just SCREAMS "there will be enemies here". And sure enough, as you
 | advance three IC will pop up, with two in the middle. I would retreat here
 | and take long-range cover from the east to protect yourself, then burn them
 | down one at a time. Blaster can likely nail two at once, then erosion down
 | anyone with high IP while using Killer when you can.
 |
 |  Continuing to the right will show our prize: the Camera Controls. Two
 | more IC will show up though, with one being a Sparky. If you have the power,
 | burn him down otherwise get into cover and kill them one at a time like
 | normal. Once you have, you are free to turn the cameras on for your team
 | and you can make your way back to the exit and leave this short matrix run.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 After the fight, head to the left and enter the room, then check the room
to the north. You'll find a small storage room with two items for us to nab:
an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] and a [_KAMIKAZE_]. Very nice.

 The main room we just fought in has a corpse you can look at in the south
west corner. We can't go to the room on the far left either, where some of
the reinforcements came from, so we're stuck with going north. Also, if you
did hack the camera controls earlier, "SecurityCam5" to the right will show
you that we have some more fighting up ahead. Lovely, right?

 Unfortunately, we can't enter fight-mode until we open this door (which is
a bit dumb because we can SEE them there) but as soon as you open the door it
is go time (be sure to save ahead of time!).




  Fight: Get to the elevator.
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 We are about fairly matched here, but thankfully once you open the door,
your turn will be first. There's a couple ways we can play this fight, but
going "normal" to start is recommended.

 Have Dietrich haste Eiger and put her sniper rifle to use, knocking off the
conjurer on turn one if you can (he will summon if you don't). From there
Glory should Adrenal Gland and knock out the drones if she can (they have
rather low health). DO NOT go too far right as you fight, else the turrets
will fire on you. Kill off the near enemies first.

 Once the first enemies are dead (the rest are normal guards) two more
reinforcements will show up from the north: A Mage and an Enforcer. Take them
out one at a time, focusing on the mage first.

 Now here's the important thing to note about this fight, and the way we
could have "done things differently" up above. If you have a Decker/Drone
Control character, you can actually rush him to the control panel up to the
north, by the door. You can also Haste him if you want to rush to it in a
single turn. Once you get there you will have some options.

 If you have [DECKING: 4] you can turn off the turrets here, but if you have
[DECKING: 5] you can interface with the turrets yourself. From here you can
shut them off like above, but if you have [DRONE CONTROL: 5], you can actually
re-program the turrets down below to TARGET Knight-Errant personnel. That's one
perk of doing this sooner rather than later, but it means putting your Drone
Control person in harm's way, so going the more standard route of taking out
the initial enemies and then having your Decker shut down the turrets is much
more safe.

 If you can't shut down the turrets, you'll have to fight them. Haste your
people (Eiger) and put her by the door, under cover. She can handle the turrets
by herself from that position, but support her however you can. Also note the
drone vent to the south here: if you have drones you can send them through here
and they will pop out behind the turrets. Easy!


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Interact with the elevator once the battle is done. You'll come across some
cells once you do, which are... quite a scene. Wow, just... wow. Perhaps someone
was testing ballistic armor?

 Once you open the door to the north, we're in for yet another fight against
Knight Errant. Ready? Let's do this!



  Fight: Getting to the Rigger...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight is another one where we have options. Quite a few options,
actually, thanks to the optional objective below:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Lock out the Knight Errant Reinforcements


 Well then, so we have about three turns to shut out the reinforcements coming
soon. If you want to shut them out ASAP, send your Decker to the left corner
ASAP. Haste him to get him over there in one turn, but BEFORE you go into the
Matrix section (which is down below... again, it is very straight-forward),
note the cell release lever here. If you open this, you let out TWO NEUTRAL
BASILISK CREATURES into the fight. They are really good for hurting the enemy,
but if you plan to quickly stop the reinforcements from coming, they are more
of a pain than anything. If not... I recommend letting them out.

 So, if you can send your decker into the matrix quickly and engage the four
enemies with the rest of your team. There is a lot of cover in here, so spread
out and do your thing: rush the nearest person with Glory (doing AP damage if
you aren't going to take them out and using her Adrenal Glad power) and either
snipe or shotgun with Eiger.


 Once you are done in the Matrix, your Decker can join the fight but until
then be sure he reaches the gate control in time and then continues on to
the paydata after that (see below). Kill off the enemies one by one and this
fight is yours.

 NOTE: If you DO NOT stop the reinforcements in time, three more guards will
       show up from the door. An Enforcer, a Captain, and a Grenadier. Release
       the Basilisk on them all if you need. Also note that the top left corner
       of the map has a SUMMON SPIRIT shrine where Dietrich can summon an
       Apocalypse spirit. Use all of this to help you as needed.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 o NET INFILTRATION: PHARMA-JOB BASEMENT
 |
 |
 |  This is another fairly straight-forward matrix area. The first area is
 | just traversing to the next area, but get ready as soon as you enter.
 |
 |  The next area starts off with two White IC at the start. Grouped up,
 | so blaster them and take them out. Beyond them are two more White IC, so
 | blast them as well and take them out before the Sparky. Once they are all
 | dead you can interact with the control and stop the reinforcements.
 |
 |  We aren't quite done yet though. Head to the south exit now and move on
 | to the next room. We face virtually the exact same enemies here: two White
 | IC at the beginning and two more in the back, with another Sparky. Again,
 | Blaster and normal shots can take these groups of White IC out easily.
 | Once you have killed all of the enemies in this area, you can access the
 | Paydata Node for the [_PAYDATA: CHEMICAL RESEARCH DATA_].
 |
 |  With that, our dive into the matrix here is done. You can hoof it back
 | if you want, or if you are still fighting in the outside world you can just
 | jack out where you are at the cost of a dump shock (-5 AP).
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 Now that everyone is dead, it is time to "take care of" the loose end here.
Head north and interact with the console by the door to let the Rigger loose,
then talk to him (his name is Thorvald Enstad).

 As usual, there is a number of things we can do here. I'll go over them all
briefly below, but what I RECOMMEND DOING in all honesty is, once you "talk"
to him, go ahead and kill him, right here and now.

 Doing this will net you an immediate karma reward too, and an objective:


 o Objective: Exit the Building

 (KARMA GAINED: 3)


 Easy enough, and you're better for it, trust me.


 ( ~ OPTIONAL ROUTE ~ )


 ALTERNATELY, we can choose to listen to the Dwarf. Go ahead and talk to him
and he'll realize why you are here, getting a panic in his face. He'll try to
bribe his way out, offering us a "Pain Inducer" and our contract money to let
him go.

 The reason I recommend killing him up above is honestly the KARMA reward, as
just taking him up on his offer reduces this and the Pain Inducer isn't really
anything special (it is a taser). Still, let's cover it down below. Agree to
help him and you'll get an objective:


 o Objective: Free the Rigger


 Walk to the exit and on the way you'll get a comment on the corpses. This
includes a chance for [ETIQUETTE: SHADOWRUNNER] for some conversation
enhancement. Continue on to the first floor (the game will auto-save... a
sign of things to come) and on your way out you'll get stopped by Thorvald
and find out what kind of person he is (hint: it's not pretty). You will also
be interrupted by three grim-looking company men.


 Now, you get stopped here no matter what. If you killed the Rigger, you
will have no problems. If you didn't though, you have even more choices!

 If you want, you can use the [ETIQUETTE: SHADOWRUNNER] and kill him off in
front of your client's representatives right here and now. You can drag this
out as well, with another [ETIQUETTE: SHADOWRUNNER] option in there for flavor,
but still the "ACT" of killing him right here gives you...


 (KARMA GAINED: 1)


 ALTERNATELY... you can choose to fight against the enemies here to help out
Thorvald if you wish, which puts us in an optional battle:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Kill Johnson's Representatives


  Fight: Freeing a Dead Man (OPTIONAL)
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This isn't much of a fight, honestly. What did you expect when you start
in this close-proximity? Hasten up Eiger and go to town with her shotgun.
You should aim for the Troll first honestly, as he has grenades that can just
wreck our little group. Once he is dead, pick off the other two enemies and
call it a day.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once the enemies are dead, the dwarf will be glad and will head into the
nearby room to grab his stash. Once he is in there you have ANOTHER choice on
what to do... with a quick button press you can rip the dwarf to pieces... or
you can let him be. Your choice.

 Either way, once you are done you can either be given (or go find) two items:
the [_PAIN INDUCER_] and [_ENSTAD'S PDA_]. The dwarf will leave at this point
and our business with him is done.


 The MAIN REASON I don't like this path is that there is NO KARMA reward.
None! Bah! But, it is still your choice in the end!


 Exit the building to continue once you are ready...


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your subway car is empty on the return trip to the Kreuzbasar. This
    stretch of the sprawling U-Bahn tunnel system doesn't see much use, it
    seems. At least not at this hour.

    As the train rattles on, you find yourself lost in thought. Old memories
    creep, unbidden, to the forefront of your mind. Memories of Monika in the
    old days, and the crew that you used to run with. Memories of success and
    failure, of wealth and poverty, of good times and bad.

    Halfway back to the Kreuzbasar, you are jolted out of your reverie by a
    buzzing sound. Your commlink. You're receiving a call.


 On our way back home we will get a call from Paul, who has a job from a
person named "Frau Miller". The job is mysterious, but very well-paying, so
of course we are in. Paul will have her meet up with us wherever you choose,
but the train will stop shortly after? This is... unusual. Go ahead and exit
the train to continue...


 o Objective: Restore Power to the Train


 Well crap, the train is going nowhere, I suppose. Head to the south to start
and to the left you can interact with an item on the ground for a [_FUSE_].
Head right now into the bathroom. Check the box on the wall to the south here
for an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_]. The other box here is a fuse box. This seems...
almost too planned doesn't it?

 Go ahead and replace the fuse in the "Track" slot and then head back to the
train. This isn't good enough to get us moving, but we can extend the tracks
to the right of the train and continue to the north. Do so and head to the
door. Enter and to the left you can bust open the storage room if you happen
to have [STRENGTH: 6], or you can have your "muscle" do it (read: Eiger). In
the room you can find an [_ARES HIGH EXPLOSIVE GRENADE_].


 Head to the north some more and enter the next room. It is... pitch black in
here. Virtually. Go ahead and turn on the power to the north to be ambushed.
GAH! Go figure!


 o Objective: Escape


  Fight: Ambush at the Train Station
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Well, we are ambushed by three mercs. This whole thing was planned to get
at us. Naturally. Well damn...

 Still, three mercs against our team isnt' too much of a challenge. Spread
out and take them out one at a time like normal to end this fight. Really
nothing special at play here, just try to use your drones or a hasted unit
to get behind them (one at a time) to flank them and give them nowhere to
hide. Note that one of them drops the [_ENCRYPTED PDA_] item after you kill
them, so be sure to pick that up.


 We aren't done once you kill the first set of mercs, as you can tell since
you will still be an battle mode. The room below us has three more enemies,
but we can buff up a bit before entering since we have to open the door. Use
this time to put Aim on Glory and Eiger and open the door. Aim for the mage
on the right if you can and take them out first, then follow up with the
rest of the enemies after that.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Well, we survived this ambush. THIS ONE at least. Heh. Head back to the train
and cross the bridge, then RETRACT it. We can't go anywhere if you don't. Once
that is done, get back on the train to continue.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The rest of the trip home is uneventful, but one thing is clear: Someone
    is hunting you. This ambush was no chance gang warfare, but an organized
    attempt on your lift. If Green Winters was right, then whoever killed him
    is now after you.

    The PDA that you retrieved from your attackers may hold some answers. It's
    time to return to your safehouse and consult Paul Amsel.


 Once you arrive back at our hideout, you'll get the usual glut of objective
notifications, but here's the new one. We also get our KARMA reward form the
mission:


 o Objective: Take the Encrypted PDA to Amsel


 (KARMA GAINED: 8)


 (-NOTE-) Your teammates should have leveled up to LEVEL 5 at this point, so
          be sure to increase their stats and abilities when you get a chance!


                                             .------------------------------.
 Spend some time to upgrade your teammates   |    Lucky Strike & Racter!    |
stats as noted above. This will really help  |------------------------------|
in future fights, especially since Eiger can | Talking to Lucky Strike will |
get a stronger weapon at level 5 and Glory   | bring up one of her crew: a  |
gets some more AP for free (or a free revive | rigger named Racter. Racter  |
method for someone... I like AP better       | is actually a party member in|
though. Once that is done you can talk to    | "Shadowrun: Hong Kong", so   |
Lucky Strike and you can get her to spill    | this is a nice little tie-in.|
some info on her team and what the tattoos   '------------------------------'
on her face mean. You can also talk to Kim outside, who is... strangely off
of her sims. You can get her to talk to you at this point (by saying you are
here to listen, like Monika was) to learn about her black eye as well as the
reason she tries to forget... which is damned depressing. I'm... so sorry for
you, Kimmy. No one should have to go through that...


 Head back to base now and talk to everyone you can, as usual. Blitz will
(SHOULD) actually have a job for you, regarding his debt that he told you
about last time. Go ahead and agree to go on the job, even if he stays behind
and we'll get a new objective (and mission):


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to Drogenkippe


 Talking to Dietrich should continue his story about following the Dragon and
fighting something bigger and bigger. Here, I recommend asking Dietrich about
talking to the Dragon about focusing on something like a gang or corporation,
you know, anything to stop his course of suicide it seems.

 Next up is Eiger. She will tell you the story of her team if you ask her
it and be *slightly* pushy, but hey, its Eiger. Still, you'll learn of her
team and what she used to do, including her dislike of new members. It seems
that we have her respect now, at least.

 Lastly we have Glory, who carries on the story of her Chrome. She picks up
where she left off with the cult and tells you what she did in it, what it
made her do, and who she served. It is all very, very eye-opening. Quite the
story and a tragic (if predicted) end. Wow...


 Once you are done talking with your team, check out your computer. You should
have some emails here from the last few runs (Jana, Silke, etc) that you can
read. You can also check out the JOBS section to "Claim payment for the Pharma
cleanup job" for a cool [_2,500 Nuyen_] payday. Enough to buy a new piece of
gear, but with no new equipment I'm just saving it for now. Also be sure to go
to the Shadowland BBS and after reading the threads (one is about you!) you can
post the "SCHERING Pharma AG chemical research data".

 Next up we can check out the third DVD on the DVD stack by the TV. "Green
Winters" will chronicle his search for Adrian a bit more here, although there
are a couple of tracks that couldn't be recovered. Still, interesting.

 Talk to Paul next and you'll tell him about the ambush. After that give him
the PDA we picked up to get a file out of it. This won't tell us much, but it
does confirm our suspicion: "Audran" is hunting us. Audran being that big troll
we tangled with at the start of the game of course. Paul has learned a bit
about him as well (there is a [BIOTECH: 4] dialog option here, nothing special
though). His medical record is actually on file, so we'll talk about what they
mean. Is he... is he actually serving Firewing as part of the "Disciples of the
Cleansing Fire"? Too hard to say right now, but it seems like it. Oh well, for
now we need to meet with our next client.


 o Objective: Meet with Frau Muller


 Time to meet with Muller wherever you choose to meet her at (the cafe for
me). Once you talk to her you will have an [ETIQUETTE: CORPORATE] dialog
opportunity (just favor text, you aren't missing anything) but will learn
that her company out here is involved in a project that she, well... won't
describe for you. But she wan't it destroyed. So much so, she wan't you to
take the building out. Wow...

 Well... we're bound to kill some security and scientists, but it is your
choice to take the mission. It is a LOT of money though and another mission
we can undertake so as a guide-writer I *MUST* take it. I recommend you do
as well.


 o Objective: Notify Amsel About Your Meeting with Frau Muller


 Talk to Paul about the job and he will recommend we take a side-trip to a
place called "OTK International" in order to help out with the job that Frau
Muller gave us. You can choose not to, but again, I'm here to guide you
through everything I can so I agreed to the more tactical plan. You may as
well too, as a good strategy is better than brute force (even though with
our tactics and team we can survive either I'm sure).


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to OTK International's Offices


 OK, we are now caught up on all the things we need to do. Now... which job
should we go out and do? Well, I recommend going and doing Blitz's job for
now, just to get it out of the way.


  NOTE: Be sure to bring along a few first aid kits on this next run... you
        may very well need them!


 Head to the U'Bahn and choose:


 "Travel to the Landenberg Ring's bank in Drogenkippe to clear Blitz's debt."


 And we'll be onto the next section!

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Drogenkippe. It'd be high up on anyone's list of places to avoid, but
    that's where you're headed... and you're going there alone this time. The
    last time that you saw Blitz, he was carting his portable terminal over to
    Cafe Cezve, presumably so that he could do his decking in the most
    comfortable environment possible.

    Like everything else related to Drogenkippe, the U-bahn train that
    services it is in poor repair. The car that you're riding in stinks like
    a chemical toilet on a hot day. On the floor near the doorway, you catch
    sight of a trampled lump of tattered fur; the longer you stare at it, the
    more convinced you become that you're looking at the remains of a long
    dead squirrel.

    The train rumbles to a stop, and the doors slide open. Time to get this
    over with.


 NOTE: This mission is only in the "Director's Cut" of Shadowrun: Dragonfall
       as I KNOW it wasn't in the first version of this game. Thankfully, all
       copies of Dragonfall are upgraded, so no worries there. Just know that
       original players never had this mission. Lucky you?


 o Objective: Clear Blitz's Debt


 What the hell are we doing out here? Freezing in the cold as Blitz is in a
cafe drinking Soykaf. Yeah, he owes us big. After chatting with Blitz, head
to the left and you'll meet the Meat Grinder's accoutant, Hasenkamp. Really?
Ask Blitz about this and well... it looks like we have company on this run.
I guess we're not entirely alone.

 Time for Blitz to do his thing and open the door for us...


 o Objective: Hassenkamp Must Survive

 o Objective: Unlock the Alley Entrance

 o Objective: Blitz Must Survive


 Ordinarily I would put a "Net Infiltration" section here, but this area is
so pathetic it doesn't deserve it. While it LOOKS big, it isn't. Head left
and up to interact with the White IC and move on to the next area (Blitz makes
this easy, I suppose), then up in the next area. Either interact with the IC
or move past it for dialog and continue on to the Alley Door node and open it
up (noting the firewall in the way).


 o Objective: Bypass the First Security Firewall


 We can finally enter the building now. Go ahead and do so, then take the
upper door. You'll be in a large room but we can't get to that middle item
quite yet, so go north to a hallway and into the right room after that.

 Here you'll see a desk and a computer. Interact with the desk first to
rummage around. By the way, Hassenkamp HATES us rummaging around. He will
make several remarks about it by the time we are done, and you can even
comment back. Hehehe... Still, this desk has a drawer you can force if you
have [STRENGTH: 4].


 NOTE: Thanks to a reader, Simon, we know what is in this drawer if you
       have STRENGTH: 4 (I didn't have four strength when I wrote this
       guide). I'm actually putting in what he emailed me down below, as
       there's some flavor text here:

       "When you open the drawer it says: "Inside is a contact book with
       an impressively long list of names. None of them stand out to you in
       any way. You also find a tube of lip balm and a cred stick."

       There is 107 nuyen on the cred stick"


 The computer here is locked and belongs to an Alberts apparently. You can
input a code, but we have no clue what it is. Alternately, you can also use
[DECKING: 4] to bypass security and get in.


 NOTE: The password for the computer is actually "123456". If you don't have
       decking, you can get in using this. It is given to us after we crack
       the computer, just so you know.


 The next room down has a desk you can check out for some [_CRAM_]. There is
also a vent here that you can send a drone through if you are able. If you can,
you will open up the door next door. In here you can find a file on some
"Grinder Financial Info". This really gets Hassenkamp's attention, by the way,
as the info is all messed up. Encourage him to talk to his employer about it
after the run if you wish. There is also a [_KEYCARD_] here you can pick up
that is an easy pass to the objective, but entirely unneccesary in the long
run, so don't sweat it.


 Head back to the entrance and go left this time. Dig through everything you
can. The first desk denotes someone names "Plotz" who owns this place, and you
can check the wall for an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] in one of the rooms. Continue
left and dig through the trash in the last room. You'll see a note about
Alberts talking about the "good stuff" at one point, which will come in handy
in a bit.

 Head north now and we'll be at a locked door. Here there are a number of ways
you can get in. If you have the KEYCARD you can just use that. If not (and who
would?! besides me...), you can also just use [DECKING: 5] to bypass the
keycode. That's not all though, you can also just use [CHARISMA: 5] to get in,
but if all of that fails... we have LIES! Tell the person who answers the call
that "you are Albert" and that you "have the good stuff" to get him to let you
in. Easy!


 Now, there is a quick fight here. Again, no section for it (it is pathetic)
but Hassenkamp will join you. He can use his laser designator to give you an
accuracy boost, so be sure to use that first and then take the decker out.


 Once he is dead, interact with the console and help Blitz get past the
firewall. If you have [DECKING: 4] you can install it right away, but if
not you can have Blitz talk you through it easily enough. This will put you
back in control of Blitz:


 o Objective: Open the First Security Door


 We are now in another Matrix section, but again, no special box for this
as it isn't hard and there's no battles. This next area is all about "Bits"
and is a small puzzle.

 The first thing you should do is head to the northwest. You will find
another firewall that Blitz can't get past. Just take note of it for now.
To the right is a "Data Node" you should interact with. Do so and delete
the files that Blitz finds.

 Well, that's one thing taken care of. After that we have a small puzzle here.
Take the left bit here to lock yourself in, then put it in the socket on the
right. That opens the bit to the south, so take it and head back and take the
right bit as well (giving you two). Put one in the left socket and leave to
the left, netting us 1 Control Bit held.

 From there, go to the upper left and take the bit standing out on its own,
That is two Control Bits held.

 Once more, head south to the start of the area. There's a place to put a
control bit on the lower right (up from where you started) that doesn't look
likes it does anything, but it lets you go north and take the control bit up
there. Return and take your first one to close that northern path but leaving
us with 3 Control Bits Held.

 That is all we need. Head to the left and put them all in the sockets to
access the "Teller Area Door". Unlock it and head out, retrieving all of
your Control Bits. From here, head to the northwest and you'll find the
node we are supposed to interact with. Use two of your control bits to open
it up and let your main character and Hassenkamp continue on.


 Back out in the real world now. To the right you can get into the teller
area to find your reward for that puzzle, an [_ARMTECH MGL-6_]. Not bad.
This grenade launcher weapon can be useful later on, so keep it in mind.
Time to press into the "Secure Area Door". Do so and you'll see security
rooms to the north and south. We can't access them though, so continue to
the left and into the next room, disengaging the second firewall just like
Blitz wants.


 o Objective: Open the Vault


 Back in the Matrix we won't have far to go. Just head left and you will
soon find the vault controls. Go ahead and open them and your meatbag team
will be able to go in.

 Do so and let Hassenkamp do his thing (you can watch him if you want). The
transaction goes through easily apparently, but Hassenkamp is not done. He
will also go to a nearby safe and pull out a small box. Here Blitz will tell
you that we should be, um... getting a cut of the box. Tell Blitz to chill at
this point and that we'll focus on getting out of here first (if you are of
the more greedy persuasion, don't worry... our greed will be sated here in a
little bit!).

	
 o Objective: Escape!


 Getting out, however... is more of a challenge apparently. Blitz can get
us in, but not out!?! Are you kidding. Note that if you have [DECKING: 4]
here, you can open the door yourself, otherwise waiting on Blitz is our
only option.

 As you head into the room where the security doors are though, things will
start to get hairy. Turns out Blitz can't suppress alarms and open doors, so
we'll have to help with releasing a northern and southern lockdown. This will
involve fighting in the real world and the Matrix. If you have [DECKING: 5],
you can help out Blitz with the Matrix part as well, but more on that below.


 o Objective: Release Northern Lockdown Console

 o Objective: Release Southern Lockdown Console


  Fight: Fighting just to leave...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As mentioned earlier, this is a real-time and matrix battle. The real-time
section is a bit of a pain, as re-inforcements don't seem to stop until you
have gotten into both north and south rooms and hit the lockdown console.

 Due to this, you will want one team member ready to move and do these
things, while the other aims for the enemies. If your main character is
combat-oriented, have them take out enemies. If not, Hassenkamp will have to
do. Focus both characters on the upper enemy first though, as they are a Mage
and should be taken out first. From there, focus on taking Blitz north when
he can (see below) to open the northern door and send someone in. It should
also be noted that each room has an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] in it as well, for TWO
in total, so be sure to grab them as you go.

 Once you take out the first enemies, more will come in from the rooms to the
upper north and south (north of the rooms you are breaking into). The first
set includes a Conjurer who should be taken out first (although it is very
possible their summon will break away and help you). By the time you deal with
them, one of the rooms should be done and you should be headed to the second
room (with Blitz opening it up for you).

 The second set of enemies will include a rigger from the north, which should
be your first target as well, as you can shut down his drone by taking him
out. Taking them out after you've triggered the second room's lockdown console
so we don't have to deal with more reinforcements (as I did... the third set
of enemies is a Guard and Grenadier by the way). That's all for this fight:
focus on the Mage and Riggers once they show up and focus on getting to the
consoles to the north and south above fighting, finishing up the enemies once
that is done and heading south towards the building exit...


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 o NET INFILTRATION: Landenberg Ring Matrix
 |
 |
 |  This is a battle in concert with the above meatspace fight, so you had
 | better be on your game! Blitz is up against quite a few IC here, but we
 | still need to take them out in a hurry!
 |
 |  The first area has FOUR White IC near the start. Get them all with
 | Blaster if you can and then kill them off one by one. Save your summons
 | for now. Heal whenever you need to as well: we are in for a long fight.
 | Once you kill them all of, continue to the southeast and fight two more
 | White IC to the south. From here we can head north or south.
 |
 |  These directions coincide with the north and south rooms in the real
 | world, so head to the north first (as you should be attacking/killing the
 | mage in the real world) and your characters are close to that door. Each
 | node area has two White IC in it, so get in cover and take them both out,
 | then use the node to open the door. That way your real world partners can
 | get in and shut off the lockdown console.
 |
 |  Do that with the southern console as well and you'll be golden.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 Exit to the south once you have both doors open and the fight will be done.

 That was a bit rough, right? If you are hurting, go ahead and use one of the
first-aid kits you picked up or one you brought (see, there was a reason for
that note before you took this mission!).

 We're not done yet though, as you can tell by the game saving. We are in for
another battle coming up, but for now continue to the front door and hit the
button like Blitz asks you to.

 Well, turns out Blitz isn't an idiot. Well... not completely. He will fill
you in that Hassenkamp is an assassin, sent to take us out. He also wants
whatever is in the box as well (still so greedy). Agree to listen to Blitz
and when you get a chance choose the first option of "Someone's out for all
of us." This will actually lead to you reasoning with Hassenkamp about why he
found the new financial books. Going through this will actually convince
Hassenkamp, putting him on your side firmly and having him confirm he WAS
supposed to kill you. Lovely. Sounds like we don't have time to worry about
that now though: more enemies are on the way!

 We are in for another Matrix / Meatspace fight, with another objective thrown
in on us:


 o Objective: Kill the Enemy Decker


  Fight: Ultimate Showdown
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 THIS... This is a rough fight. Rough but very, very good. As you can see,
the room we are in is surrounded by turrets and they aren't exactly going to
stay on our side. This is due to the nodes for them being in the matrix, and
there are matrix enemies in this fight that can turn the nodes to their side.
Great, right!? What is better though is that for some reason, the two turrets
by us are hostile, while the two turrets by the enemies are friendly (you
would think that it would be reversed).

 Still, in meatspace we have little choice but to get in cover and focus on
the enemies. Now, to start off with we will face FOUR enemies. They are
somewhat grouped together, so use grenades and your grenade launcher to help
take them out (Use all of Hassenkamp's items if you want, what do we care,
we don't get to keep them!). As you fight, your battle in the Matrix will be
of the utmost importance so be sure to ace it to help yourself out immensely
in this regular fight.

 Ideally, by the time you are about to kill all four enemies, your Matrix
fight will be done and you will have all four turrets under your control.
There is more real-time fighting though: four more enemies will show up.
With all four turrets on our side though, they should fall fairly easily and
this fight will be over (still, while the second group is grouped up, use
those grenades and grenade launcher!).


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 o NET INFILTRATION: Landenberg Ring Matrix Showdown
 |
 |
 |  This is the REAL fight in the two fights going on. Mr. Plotz is the
 | Decker here and he isn't about to let us go. As mentioned above, the
 | BIGGEST THING to do here is control the turrets: last thing we need is
 | our friends getting shot up in the real world.
 |
 |  For that reason it is a good idea to go ahead and summon your two programs
 | right at the start, and then send one to the northeast and the other send
 | northwest. From there, just get close to Plotz in preparation to take him
 | out. For his part he will summon a program who, in one turn, will turn the
 | upper left turret on to the enemies side. Not much we can do about that.
 |
 |  Now, on your next turns, we need to focus on taking out Plotz ASAP. If
 | you have full health, I find spending one turn to get close to him, one
 | turn on EROSION, and one on a direct attack a good idea. This is a bit
 | risky as he can hurt us quite a bit, but we get three turns to his two
 | and he often attacks only once. Follow him and bomb him hard as we need to
 | stop him and his summon ASAP to stop them from turning turrets to their
 | side. After three to four turns with bombing him hard and erosion he should
 | fall. From there, just go turn all the turrets to your side once again.
 |
 |  Once you are done with that, Blitz will tell your main character he is
 | done and the game will stop keeping track of Blitz from this point forward.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 Once this (rather fantastic, honestly) fight is done, you will be given the
[_MYSTERY BOX_] from Hassenkamp and we will go our separate ways, all squared
up. Well... it sounds like he is about to take care of our betrayers for us,
and Blitz is officially out of debt, so all in all this is a fairly good
outing. Time to leave.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The ride back to the Kreuzbasar is a lonely one. This train car smells a
    little better than the one you rode in on; it isn't great, but at least
    it doesn't leave you gagging. Still, things are looking up. You've helped
    Blitz pull himself out of hot water, and with any luck at all, you'll
    never have to set foot in Drogenkippe again.

    After a long, boring trip, the car rattles to a stop. The doors slide
    open. You're home.


 Once you get home, you will get get a small karma reward:


 (KARMA GAINED: 2)


 We're not quite done yet though, go ahead and visit Blitz back at the
hideout and give him the box. He'll open it up and reveal it as a cyberdeck
upgrade (which our main character can't use, even if we are a decker
apparently) and he'll tell you it is a set of sys admin codes that essentially
let you hack any comm link. Period. Well then...

 You can follow up with him about his ex-GF as well, Emilie. Encourage him to
continue searching for her after he tells you the updated story.

 All of our other party members still have nothing to say... this was a
sidequest for Blitz after all, so they all act like we haven't done any new
missions. Bah. Well, we CAN check our computer and claim that paydata we put
up for sale last mission, which should net you a cool [_387 NUYEN_].


 Nothing else to do for now, so let's take on another mission. This time,
head to the U-Bahn and select:


 "Assemble the team and travel to the AG Chemie Europa facility to extract
  the MKVI prototype."


 Time to gear up for the next mission!

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Monolithic. Plastic. Sterile. The Berlin office of AG Chemie Europa is
    all of these things and more. The worst qualities of modern corporate
    culture, all mixed into a toxic stew and sluiced into a single prefab
    office building.

    Thankfully, you shouldn't have to stay long. According to the intil that
    your client provided, this should be a simple smash-and-grab operation,
    and you've been given the tools to carry it out with a minimum of fuss.

    The MKVI Prototype - whatever it is - is waiting for you on the 25th
    floor. It's time to go and get it.


 It has been A WHILE since we agreed to do this mission, so just to catch you
up we agreed to acquire the MKVI Prototype. This gives us a couple of new
objectives as well:


 o Objective: Reach the 25th Floor

 o Objective: Shutdown Building Security


 We start off in a big warehouse. Head to the northwest corner and inspect
the crates. "Project Atlas". Hmm. Grab the [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] from the left
wall and then open the gate nearby. Interact with the console and use that
little black box the client gave us. Sure enough, it cuts power to the entire
building (minus emergency lights) and should kill the cameras too. Time to
get to the elevator.

 As you get near the elevator, THE LODGE will contact us. Luca knows about
our mission here, and wants us to deliver the MKVI to them. Typical, right?
We would just need to load the object on their transport and they will take
care of our client as well. Hmmm...


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Return the Prototype Undamaged to the Lodge


 We can worry about that in a bit, for now on to the elevator.


  24th Floor
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 We have feeds of the entire floor thanks to the black box. Very handy.

 Head south to start and read the sign by the locked door for another optional
objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Clear the Toxic Gas from the Lab


 There are a number of ways to do this, actually. Naturally. The first is
to use [BIOTECH: 4] to search your memory for COC12 info. This lets you
remember how to neutralize the gas. Barring that, you can also use the
"Purge Air" option if you have [DECKING: 5].

 Barring that though, you need to know how to neutralize the air in here,
which we will get to find out soon from the records room. If you don't feel
like going there and just want to get this done now, type in "Ammonia" and
the room will be cleared, netting us a total of...


 (KARMA GAINED: 3)


 Head inside the room now and grab the [_JAZZ_] from the table after you
examine the body. On the far wall you can also find a code, "54139", which
will be very handy later. There is an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] to find as well.

 After that, check the computer here to learn what is going on. There are
four entries you can check in total, but the thing that should stand out
to you is "Formula 17".


 OK, head up past the elevator now and left. There are LOTS of rooms over
here but let's do this in some sort of order. Let's check the offices first.
The lower room is the "Building Maintenance" room and has a [_BASIC MEDKIT_]
in it.

 From there, head north to the "Junior Exec" room. Here you can use the
ETIQUETTE: SOCIALITE] to examine the bottles on the bar.


 NOTE: (777) Apparently, if you have this you get a better bottle of booze
             to sell later. I haven't confirmed this. If you know, let me
             know. Seems legit though. You can sell the booze to Altug
             once you get back to town.


 Either way, grab a bottle from the bar for the road (you will get "Mission
Item: Cheap Booze" if you grab one without knowing any better) and then go
ahead and check out the terminal. Here you will get the "Schockwellenreiter
Message" (the group from the pay phone in our neighborhood). They want to
gain the info on what AG Chemie Europa is up to, asking you to gather up
info for them:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL) Schockwellenreiter: Project Data

 o Objective (OPTIONAL) Schockwellenreiter: Drug Formula

 o Objective (OPTIONAL) Schockwellenreiter: Visual Records


 Well... we will get to that soon.

 First though, let's head up to the "Senior Exec" office. Here you can check
out the keypad with [SPELLCASTING/CONJURING] to examine the keypad for the
codes or you can just use the code "54139" which we got from the lab room
(or we will if you haven't yet). This lets you into the room where you can
search the desk for, um... love notes, but also another password: "84792".
Another important password that we'll use in a bit.


 NOTE: Reader Tyro Kathar notes that you can use the "84792" password in
       place of the "54139" password down below (in multiple places) if you
       wished to.


 The room to the north just tells you to go search the records archive for
more info on "Project Atlas" by the way.


 OK, next up is the all-important RECORDS ROOM! Seriously, this is where you
get a LOT of info. The only thing in here is a record terminal that asks you
what you want to search for.

 Start out with "Formula 17" (without the spaces, so Formula 17) and when it
asks for a passcode use either "54139" or [DECKING: 5]. This will fulfill one
of the Schockwellenreiter objectives.

 Next up, search for "Project Atlas". Again, without quotes. And again, like
last time, use "54139" or [DECKING: 5] to access it. You will get a lot of
corporate speak here, but you can get a synopsis of it all with the
[ETIQUETTE: CORPORATE] ability. Either way, this satisfies the "Project Data"
part of the optional objective.

 Finally, under Project Atlas there is a "Visual Records" option that requires
a VP level password (meaning 54139 won't work). The password you need to use
here is "84792", which we got from the senior exec room. Or you can also use
[DECKING: 6] if you have it. This completes the last bit of the optional
objective.


 Finally, you can also search here for the "COC12" (without quotes) to learn
about Ammonia or Sodium Bicarbonate to neutralize the gas in the lab.


 The only thing left to do in this floor is to take on the Security Room.
If you want. This is very much an optional fight, but there is loot on the
line so I am all for it!


  Fight (OPTIONAL): Looking for a Fight (Give me your loot!)
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is a fairly easy fight, but you will likely have some bruises to show
for it nonetheless. The security room has five people manning it, two of which
are squishy mages so aim for them first. As you open the door in fact, the
enemy gets their turn first, mostly running for cover. They may very well come
out and attack you though, so kill off anyone dumb enough to do that.

 After that, aim for the mages and then pick off the rest of the enemies one
by one until they are all dead. Nothing special. Buff up Eiger and Glory as
you can and use Eiger's shotgun (not enough room for long-range). Kill one at
a time and try to get Glory behind the enemy lines to always have a flanking
attack ready to go.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once the enemies are all dead, you can now loot the gun cabinet on the far
wall to acquire a [_MOSSBERG CMDT (SMARTLINK)_]. Very nice.


 Finally, let's head to the next floor. To do so, head to the elevator next
to "Security Camera 1". Here you can use [SPELLCASTING/CONJURING] or the code
"54139" to activate the elevator and move on to the next floor, prompting a
loading screen to show up:



 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The elevator whisks you upward, toward the executive-level 25th floor.
    As expected, the run has been relatively smooth sailing so far. A chime
    breaks the silence as the elevator glides to a stop.

    The MKVI is somewhere on this floor. All that you have to do is find it.



  25th Floor
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 o Objective: Recover the Prototype


 This floor is pretty short, unlike the other floor. Head to the left past
a large room (take note of this room) and continue to the upper room,
finally ending up in a room with... a troll? THIS thing IS the MKVI
Prototype, and it looks like it is built to be a killing machine.

 Interact with the console and, if you have Glory on your team, you can have
her inspect the troll's chrome job. She will reveal a rather startling
discovery that I just have to share here: this troll is CONSCIOUS under that
metal, but he has no control of his own actions. Holy... shit. Wow.

 You can, if you want, tell Glory to try and disable the system to give him
back his free will, but if you do she'll say to save it for the parking
garage and she is quite correct: we need to get him out of here no matter
what we plan on doing with him. Also note that if you have [DRONE CONTROL: 4],
you can interface with the troll more directly.


 NOTE: (777): I've read that doing this gives you 4 AP with the Troll, vice
              3. I actually got to choose this option (my main character is a
              Rigger/Decker hybrid) and can confirm if gives you 4 AP, but in
              retrospect I didn't try it without this option yet, so can't
              confirm you get 3 AP normally.

              I can confirm (Thanks to multiple readers) that my above
              guessing is correct. I should also add, thanks to Tyro, that
              you can have BLITZ rig the prototype as well to gain 4 AP
              that way.


 o Objective: Escape with the Prototype


 Of course, getting out isn't going to be EASY, is it? Naturally! A Knight
Errant Captain will stop you in the big room I mentioned earlier. You can
attempt to talk your way out of this (and bringing up the troll definitely
gives him a bit of a pause), but there's no getting out of this fight in
the end:


  Fight: Out for a test-drive
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is a pretty fun battle. Actually, in all honesty all of the battles
left in this chapter are just... so good. So very, very good. And that is
because of the walking tank that is the "MKVI Prototype" that is on our team.

 Seriously, this guy is a beast. Not only can he take a ton of damage, but
he comes equipped with a fricking Gattling Gun, as well as a giant axe that
he is very deadly and proficient with. As mentioned above, with [DRONE
CONTROL: 4] he has 4 AP per turn as well and can just wreck face. Put him in
the front lines and either use that axe or that 2-shot gattling gun ability.
And if any enemies are dumb enough to stand next to each other, the axe has
a cleave ability that lets you hit multiple people (the gattling gun has this
too, but at range). This troll is going to be a huge help not only in this
battle but getting out of this building period as he can almost be counted
upon to kill a target per turn (minus the occasional misses, of course).

 Enough about the walking tank though, let's focus on this battle. As you
can see, there are seven enemies in total. Aside from the guards, we got a
Mage, Conjurer, Grenadier and Rigger. Now, the Rigger should get a very
special note here:

 *IMPORTANT NOTE*

 Riggers will attempt to gain control of the MKVI Prototype for the rest of
 this mission. DO NOT let them gain control!

 *END IMPORTANT NOTE*

 What this means is that we must target the Rigger first. Killing him ensures
that the troll remains on our side (and we definitely want that!). I recommend
focusing on him with Eiger sniping. At the start of the round you want to
spread out quickly (your team is very grenade-prone right now), then have
Dietrich put Aim on Eiger and take that rigger out. If you can't in one turn,
no worries: just haste Eiger the next turn and get the job done.

 In the meantime, the troll should be tearing up the front lines. Go after
the squishy targets (Mage, Conjurer) with him and Glory to thin their numbers,
then focus on taking everyone else out one at a time. As long as you spread
out at the beginning and take out the Rigger first, this battle is as good
as yours.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once the battle is done you should heal up anyone who REALLY needs it with any
medkits you have and then head downstairs. As soon as you get downstairs, you
are going to be in a fight, so be ready. A very LONG fight...


  24th Floor
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 And here comes the pain!


  Fight: A LONG way to the Parking Garage
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As mentioned, this is going to be a very long battle. We have plenty of
guards just around the corner and, as you can see, they have hallways blocked
off here strategically to tunnel us through the way they want us.

 This first set of enemies has a Rigger, so you know who your first mark
should be. As you fight, more enemies will come in the back, including a Mage
and a Conjurer just so you are aware. Seven enemies in total for this first
area (yes, I said first area... there are multiple areas).

 Start by buffing Eiger (I'd go Aim first here) and putting her in the back
corner. Perfect sniping view of the entire hallway, and should let you plug
the Rigger by the second turn (Haste her on the second turn). Glory can use
her Adrenal Pump ability to get up in the enemies face quickly while the tank
troll does his thing (have him wipe out the front enemies while Eiger and
Glory take care of the squishy magic users). This first area is pretty easy
since half the enemies come in after the fighting starts, so you should be
able to take them out without a lot of trouble. Just spread out as best as
you can here as the guards do have grenades.


 BUT, we aren't done. More fighting to be done. Move your entire team together
around the corner and to the south are some more enemies just waiting for you.
Five enemies this time, including a Grenadier, Conjurer and a Mage (to name
the notable enemies). Advance together and take them on. Eiger can snipe a bit
at an angle here, but you'll have to move up regardless so the troll and Glory
should be storming the lines (and your main character, if they are combat
oriented... drones for me). These enemies aren't too tough, but even after you
take them out you STILL won't be done with this fight...

 NOTE: You can have a decker open the door by the security office, but it
       doesn't help hardly at all here so don't bother.

 Gather up once again. Further in, there will be a MASSIVE number of enemies
waiting for you. Well... eight enemies in total, but they are all in cover
waiting for you to round the next corner. Note the drone vent to the south
before the corner turn though: if you send drones through here you can pop
them out by the sniper in the back but do so as you are ready to attack the
enemy (not before).

 There's a wide variety of enemies here, including a Sniper in the back, a
Grenadier, a Mage and a Rigger. Tons of soldiers too, so a LOT of grenade
throwing is possible (read: spread out!). As usual, I recommend charging with
your troll and Glory and buffing Eiger and having her aim for the Rigger. If
you can pop out the drones in the back and take out the sniper, even better.

 Consider having your troll make melee kills here as deaths to thin out the
enemy number are very much needed. Glory should Adrenal Boost as well to help
out. Once Eiger kills the Rigger, focus on softer targers with her. This is
great as around the corner near the elevator area there's five MORE enemies,
and as you scramble in the middle of this fight they will come out. Lots of
soft targets though (Conjurer, Mage), so Eiger should have a field day. I
literally had her dropping bodies left and right here (finishing off Glory's
kills as needed, hitting soft targets). This is a very big battle though, so
have Dietrich heal as needed and support when he can, hasting Eiger but
throwing up Aim for Glory and Eiger as well. Try to put him in cover when you
do this as he can be a target and can draw some fire (which can help).

 Still, this is a heck of a fight. The troll makes it a ton easier, but don't
be afraid to use a medkit if needed and focus on reducing enemy numbers and
taking out the softer targets first (Rigger, Conjurer, Mages, Sniper). Do that
and this battle will be in the bag.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Well... now all that is left is to head down to the basement and wrap this
mission up. Take the elevator down now.


 Once you get to the basement you SHOULD have three choices to make for the
ending. You can either...


 o Have Glory disconnect the creature from the controller.

 o Ship the creature as planned.

 o Deliever the creature to The Lodge.


 Now, just so you know you get paid the same no matter what you pick, and
the KARMA reward is the same too (we'll get our karma once we get back to
the Kreuzbasar).

 The "Glory" option is definitely the more... humane option of the three
though, and will please your team the most (even the uptight Eiger!). It
will piss off your employer though, although getting no further work from
them isn't an issue for the rest of the game. And the "Lodge" option is the
Lodge option: if you have started working for them already I recommend
sticking with them, but if now I wouldn't bother.

 In the end, this is a personal choice and there's no absolute "right" way
here, so follow your gut and make your choice. No regrets. Let's head back
home, chummer.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The U-Bahn feels especially cramped on your ride back to the Kreuzbasar.
    In your mind's eye, you can still see the carnage that you left behind
    at the AG Chemie building. Memories replay themselves over and over in
    your mind - fleeting visions of a hulking thing made of muscle and chrome.

    You put them aside. Shelve them for later. The job is over; it's time to
    collect your pay.



 NOTE: There is a mission coming up that will GREATLY benefit us if we have
       [CHARISMA: 4]. If you have nothing better to spend karma on, this will
       help you out a ton. If you have [ETIQUETTE: SECURITY] it isn't needed
       as much. The mission is Chapter 15 by the way, so this is a BIG heads
       up so you have time to prepare.


 Once we get home, we'll get our reward as promised above:


 (KARMA GAINED: 10)


 Additionally if you did the optional objectives in the mission, you can head
north to the phone booth and turn them in here and now. You'll get a karma
reward and  [_1,000 NUYEN_] as some spending money:


 (KARMA GAINED: 2)


 Now that you are done with that, go check in with Paul like he asked. The
whole team should be here. Paul will mention that he's tracked a shipment of
an "X-15" bio weapon to... Harfield Manor. FANTASTIC. Our dragon has a bio
weapon now. Still, Dietrich is right, this doesn't really change much for us.
We still need to find our dragon-killer.


 Time to check-in with the team like usual.

 Blitz will give you an update on the Emilie situation. Again, I like to
encourage him to find the truth, even if it seems a bit... stalker-ish?
That's a word, right? Still, he's going to do what he wants right? Note that
if you have [DECKING: 5] here you can offer to help, but it doesn't matter
as Blitz is running solo here.

 Talk to Dietrich next and urge him to commune with the dragon like we
discussed last time we talked to him. This turns out interesting and you can
recommend a fight for the Flux State if you wish. He will also tell us more
of his punk story. You can even encourage him to get active again as a better
(and wiser) role-model.

 Next up is a very important chat with Eiger. Ask her to tell you what is
bugging her and she will show you a picture of "Yuli Kozlov". He was/is
apparently a high-value target from her military days, associated with
grooming neighborhoods for gang takeover and is currently nearby, which
prompts Eiger to tell you she is dropping out of the group for a few missions
to take care of him.

 No reason to let her go alone though! Insist that you should go to help her
(I wouldn't recommend the other demand options) and she will agree to take
you (and only you) along, telling you to meet her at Der Weinkeller:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Meet with Eiger's Contact


 Sweet, optional mission for Eiger unclocked!


 NOTE: Much like the Blitz side-mission, this mission (and the Glory  mission
       down below) are only found in the "Shadowrun: Dragonfall Director's Cut"
       version of the game, which only affects those of us who played the game
       when it first came out.


 Next up is Glory. She'll ask about your feelings knowing her and her story.
She's done her best to get away, so it's hard not to feel sad for her. Still,
you should "ask her if we should do something about Harrow" to get her to
agree that it is time to pay him a visit. This is of course her own personal
side-mission, but she brings up an important point here: do we focus on taking
out Harrow, our freeing the kids? Choose what you will for now, we have time
to make up our mind on the actual mission itself:


 o Objective: Take the Van to Harrow's Compound


 Now that we are caught up with our team, let's check our computer. We should
have an email from Malitt stating that she has made one last DVD available,
so we'll have to check that out. Also, claim payment for your last job in the
jobs section for your cut of [_3,750 NUYEN_]. Finally, let's check out the
fourth and last DVD by the TV. This DVD explores what, or how exactly, Adrian
ended up stopping the Firewing. Or, at least what it looks like he did
(according to Hermie anyways). Still, very good proof that the dragon is very
much still alive.


 NOTE: After going through this fourth and last DVD, you will get the
       "Historical Record" Steam Achievement. Congrats!


 Before we go to our next mission, head to the Wine Celler for the optional
objective to meet with Eiger's contact. You'll find them on the right further
in, so go talk to her contact, Bannik. "Professional Acquaintance" mind you!
Talk to him for information on the Engineer and after some very good intel
we will get the [_CYBERWARE DEACTIVATOR_], which we'll need to immobilize the
cyberware-packed engineer.


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to Schattennest


 Well OK, we are now to the point where we have to pick a new mission to do.
We have two new side-mission though: Eiger and Glory. I say we do one of them
first. Doesn't really matter to me, so let's go ahead and roll with Eiger and
track down this Engineer person.


 Head to the U-Bahn and choose to:


 "Call Eiger and travel to the Schattennest to locate the Engineer."


 And let's go!

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Schattennest. The kiez next door to the Kreuzbasar, and an object lesson
    in anarchy gone wrong. Violent gangs rule the streets here, trading
    territory to the roar of gunfire. The streets are a warzone.

    As dangerous as Schattennest already is, it could be worse. The gangs
    are vicious, but disorganized - they pose little risk to their neighbors.
    With little more than a makeshift barricade and a few volunteers, the
    Kreuzbasar has successfully insulated itself from the chaos of its
    neighboring kiez.

    The Engineer could change all of that. He has to be stopped, and the
    F-State as a whole needs to be alerted to what his clients are trying
    to do. It's up to you and Eiger to make sure that happens.


 NOTE: This mission is only in the "Director's Cut" of Shadowrun: Dragonfall
       as I KNOW it wasn't in the first version of this game. Thankfully, all
       copies of Dragonfall are upgraded, so no worries there. Just know that
       original players never had this mission. Lucky you?


 o Objective: Locate the Engineer

 o Objective: Eiger Must Survive


 Time to go find us the Engineer. Head left to the neighborhood watch and he
should let you right through (he remembers us from earlier... heh). From here
you can head up or left. Go left first and check out the homeless person's
bedding to find a credstick. Your choice to take it or not. If you do, you'll
gain [_63 NUYEN_] and a dirty conscience...

 Go back and head up now, checking the corner as you head up to find some
[_BLISS_] just sitting there. As you head up, Eiger will point out some gang
members nearby and tell you that we should try to move around them. Well, that
is good advice really: we have * NO * reason to fight these thugs. I mean, you
can if you want but there's no reason to (we'll be in a fight soon enough).
Keep heading north and you'll come to a large area and be safely past the
thugs (just don't go right).

 If you DO want to fight them, just run right when Eiger points them out
(or you can go north and then right again, past the fence near the armed
guard). Either way, if you walk into them you'll get into a fight.


  Fight (OPTIONAL): We're just going for a walk man, sheesh!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Getting into a life-and-death battle just because we walked down the wrong
street. Oh man. This is a very easy fight though. The first two enemies (if
you are going from the bottom) include a Conjurer, so be sure to take them
out first. That leaves one guard at the bottom and one at the top. The top
one spends a round or two just getting in range, so you should be ready for
him once he shows up.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 In the back of this area you will find a couple of people you can talk to
and, to the left, the warehouse that we need to get into. Talk to the man on
the right if you wish for a view from the street. The woman selling pots on
the left is more note-able though: she will want SOMETHING in return for her
help. If you want her info (which you DO NOT NEED AT ALL), you can buy it out
of her for [50 Y]. Or use the [ETIQUETTE: STREET] skill you may have. Note that
she wants another [25 Y] for even more info. All this info she tells you is
very underwhelming: there's something going on in the warehouse, etc, etc. We
get it.


 Now, to get INTO the warehouse. The door is locked, but if you happen to be
a decker you can use [DECKING: 5] to open it and get into the fight below. If
you can't do that, we can put in a code here, but where do you find the code?
Yeah... the pots lady knows.

 You can go ask her for it, but like you may have guessed she's not about to
give it out for free. Nope. You can get if if you use [ETIQUETTE: STREET] or
[STRENGTH: 5]. If you can't do either of those, you can buy it off of her for
[500 Y]. Quite a steep price, right?

 OR... ol' BK can just give it to you! This is a GUIDE after all. If you do
try to buy it, the pot lady says "292.. something", leaving you with 75% of
the code. The code is really "2924", so you can always just use that to get
into the warehouse.

 Alternatively, you can have Eiger blow the door, but I wouldn't recommend
this at all. Better to go in quiet than loud if you can help it, but it's
your choice. You'll get in but the enemies will all be alerted. No matter
what you do though, you'll be in a battle once you enter the warehouse:


  Fight: Capture the Engineer!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 No matter how quiet you are, we are in a forced fight once we enter the
warehouse. The first area has a Conjurer and Ganger to the left and a Guard
to the right (he takes a few turns to realize what is going on). Use this
time to take out the two enemies to the left (focus on the mage) and then
start heading right when you can, taking on the guard who comes down from the
next room.

 From here the Engineer will run to the north. Don't worry too much about
this: we'll get him after we deal with the enemies. Take out the guard on
the right and advance up and left, into the main room where the lieutenant
and mage are waiting for you. Have Eiger either hang back and snipe the mage
or you can deal with him and let her come close for shotgun shots (whatever
her specialty is).

 From here head north out towards the exit the Engineer came from, taking out
the Enforcer on the right. Once you have him, get near the exit and leave
with your main character and Eiger. The scene will transition to the streets
once you are out.


 Out on the streets we get several objectives in a row as the Engineer is
running away from us:


 o Objective: Use the Cyberware Deactivator on the Engineer
 o Objective: The Engineer Must Survive
 o Objective: Do Not Let the Engineer Escape


 This is actually REALLY easy, so don't stress: on your first turn send Eiger
forward with ONE MOVE and then use an AP GRENDADE (not a regular grenade) on
the Engineer. This will stun him. Your main character should get next to him
and use the Cyberware Deactivator on him now (which will take two turns, but
with him stunned this isn't a problem). We're not quite done yet though:


 o Objective: Clear the Area of Rammbock Gangers


 Still some punks in the area. They show up as two guards from the left, one
with a shotty, so take him down first if you can (or just whoever: focus on
one to turn the tide). Once you are done with them, the battle will finally
be over and we'll head back into the warehouse automatically...


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 We can now interrogate the Engineer, which... isn't going to go too well at
the start. We'll get a couple of names ("Tamanous" and some ghoul named Beetle)
but we don't learn much. Rough him up if you like though. He deserves it, trust
me. After a bit of questioning and beating, Eiger will tell you to check out
the warehouse for clues.

 The areas you want to check are:


 o Ledger to the south.

 o Forklift to the south.

 o Top Left Room, check Corpse (chance for [BIOTECH: 4] here).

 o Chemical Barrels to the north.

 o Courier Drone x2 to the northeast (chance for [INTELLIGENCE: 2] or
   [DRONE CONTROL: 4] here).


 The most important things here are the [_LEDGER_] to the south (inspecting
it lets you pocket it), the corpse, and the drones. Go down to the ledger
and take it, then check-in with Eiger. You'll get some dialog about the ledger
and the apparently addresses in here, but more importantly you will get the
keyword "Wednesday". Still nothing from the Engineer though.

 Next go check the corpse, but we don't get too much from that either, but
it is clear they died happy. Wow... go check the Courier Drone now, which is
a big swing point on how this mission turns out. You can check the drone to
see the cargo space is locked (using that [INTELLIGENCE: 2] option shows you
this). There are a couple ways to get to it, and smashing the drone is NOT the
way to do it (you get a lesser reward from this mission if you do that).

 Instead, if you have [DRONE CONTROL: 4] here use it. If you don't though
(and chances are that you don't), use the control panel you find to be able
to input a password. Can you guess what it is? Yep... "Wednesday". Do it
without the quote and you will find the [_HOMEMADE SIMSENSE CHIP_].


 After you've investigated everything, return to Eiger and discuss what you
have found, saving the Simsense Chip for last. This ties into how the corpse
could have gone out (with the dialog having an [ETIQUETTE: STREET] in there
somewhere), with Eiger telling you to go check the corpse again. Do so and
sure enough you will find a [_MELTED SIMSENSE CHIP_].

 Return to the interrogation and the Engineer absolutely goes BERSERK with
wanting the chip. He's definitely wacked out and wants it bad, and will even
(supposedly) give us the name of his REAL employer: "Winternight". Which
means nothing to Eiger.

 Now, there is another mission difference here: when it comes to what to do
with the Engineer. be sure to select "let him slot the thing" and then take
the deal that he offers, which is a modified rifle hidden in a vent to the
left. Watch what happens to him after that and then go and claim your prize:
a new [_STEYR AUG-CSL] rifle for Eiger, giving her a mid-range option to go
along with her shotgun and sniper rifle.


 NOTE: If you do not come away with the [_HOMEMADE SIMSENSE CHIP_] above,
       you really have no leverage with the Engineer, and you never learn
       about "Winternight" or the rifle under the vent. Instead, after he
       blows up, Eiger searches him and comes away with a new grenade, the
       "Voltaic Grenade", which gets added to her item inventory from here
       on out (one new grenade per mission).


 Nothing left to do now, so let's get out of here and head back home.


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The U-Bahn whisks you back toward the Kreuzbasar. Eiger standing by your
    side. The image of the Engineer's body disintegrating in flame replays
    itself over and over in your mind; the bright flash, the shower of sparks,
    the overpowering stench of sizzling meat. A blue-green afterimage hangs
    suspended in the corner of your field of vision, and it refuses to be
    blinked away.

    From what Eiger told you, the Engineer was a menace. An international
    criminal at the top of his game. And as you watched, he was consumed from
    within by a device that marked him as disposable.

    The rattle of your U-Bahn car coming to a halt shakes you from your
    reverie. You're home.


 We'll get a small karma reward for helping out Eiger:


 (KARMA GAINED: 2)


 Head back to the hideout and talk to Eiger for a de-briefing of sorts, which
changes depending on what you did or didn't learn. All of your other teammates
act like nothing has happened (which is much like after we did Blitz's mission:
they don't view Eiger's mission as us having done a "new mission").


 Shops aren't updated either. Bah, I feel like we should have new items by
now, don't you? I suppose it is all these side missions! We're not about to
stop now though, as we have another side-mission to do for Glory.


 To get to this mission, go to your hideout and from there go SOUTH back down
to the sewer area we first entered from. You will be able to get to the VAN
you need from here.


 We are going to "Take the Van to Harrow's Compound" now and give Glory the
closure she needs (as well as stop Harrow). Go ahead and do so now.

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The drive from the Kreuzbasar to the Schonbuch Forest was a long one.
    For over six hours, you and Glory rode in relative silence, with only
    the sounds of the road for company.

    Now you find yourself crouching in the woods, watching, waiting. Off in
    the distance, the rustic exterior of Feuerstelle looks curiously warm
    and inviting, but you know what's waiting inside. The anticipation churns
    at your guts like a living thing.

    Eventually, a van pulls out of the compound's driveway and rolls out
    along a service road before disappearing from view. Glory gives you a
    nod and begins to scramble forward.

    Harrow has left the building. It's time for you to make your way inside.


 NOTE: This mission is only in the "Director's Cut" of Shadowrun: Dragonfall
       as I KNOW it wasn't in the first version of this game. Thankfully, all
       copies of Dragonfall are upgraded, so no worries there. Just know that
       original players never had this mission. Lucky you?


 As Harrow leaves, Glory will go over the plan with us. It mainly entails the
details about a shrine that has been installed since Glory left, which is
responsible for the pleasant feeling we're feeling, keeping the teens here
with its aura. We need to purify it. Glory has us covered on that front though
so no worries. Time to do this.


 o Objective: Keep Glory Safe

 o Objective: Get to the Shrine


 Head inside the house and you'll notice there are a few hallways here and
thankfully no one wandering around to make things... awkward too early. Gotta
love video game logic! First things first though: check out the door to the
left and try to enter it.

 This is where the actual shrine is that Glory was talking about and just
trying to open this door is oppressive. You can do it if you can pass a
[WILLPOWER: 6] check, but if you can't we'll have to search for the key.
EITHER WAY I recommend SEARCHING for the key, as there is plenty of stuff to
find in this house before we go after the objective anyways. Still, trying to
get through the door brings up Marta and some objectives to focus on:


 o Objective: Confront Marta

 o Objective: Open the Door to the Shrine


 Time to explore this house. Note that there will be several times where
Glory will push us to stay on target ("we don't have time for this") but I
recommend ignoring her and fully exploring the area. It doesn't change the
story at all and there's plenty of important things to find. Be sure to SAVE
at this point, just in case...


 To start out, check the door right to your right. You won't enter, but can
hear some Acolytes torturing a park ranger. Glory will try to get you to
ignore this, but DO NOT listen to her and intervene:


  Fight: Save the Park Ranger!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 We are facing two acolytes here who have some mage abilities (Acid Bolt),
but aren't particularly hard to kill at all. They do start at the back of
the room though, and upon opening the door they get their turn first meaning
that they can hit your main character with the odd shot after getting in cover
(if they are lucky). Just this randomness can or may be worth a restart if
they get a lucky critical hit in or something (or they do more damage to you:
remember that you heal all wounded damage once the fight ends). Otherwise,
just focus on one of them at a time (use Glory's Adrenaline Boost... may as
well) and they will fall before you know it.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the fight is over, talk to the messed-up Park Ranger. He's been hurt
pretty badly, but Glory will patch him up good enough to send him on his way.
As a form of thanks, he advises us of a vent in the garage where he stashes
some of his tools, encouraging us to use them as he doesn't need them. Awesome.
Also be sure to check out the "Trid Player" here to have Glory bring up her
memories about it and how she acquired it. Yeah...


 Well, we can now go right or up. Let's go up next (the order doesn't really
matter). North from the entrance and to the left is another door. Opening it
shows Harrow's Office and its empty. In here you can inspect his terminal.
If you have [DECKING: 5] you can hack his computer for [_PAYDATA: HARROW'S
BRIBES_]. Sweet paydata we can sell on the Shadowland BBS later, but you
pretty much only get this if you are a decker yourself.

 There is also a large tome in this room that you can read (although Glory
doesn't want you to). Despite Glory's protest, I RECOMMEND reading the whole
thing. To understand parts of it you will need the [ETIQUETTE: ACADEMIC]
skill, but it is just for flavor text/understanding here (you don't get
anything special not having it). You will stop after readings as Glory points
out that the atmosphere is getting dangerous as you continue and the game
keeps asking if you want to keep reading. Ominous, right? Keep reading though
and by the end you will have not only learned some things about this cult but
also summoned a demon!

 This thing is a "Seeker" and isn't particularly tough so no battle box for
him! Gang up on him and take him out. Shouldn't be a problem with a 2 on 1
battle. We're done with this office now, but reading the entire tome will
indeed help later on!


 Head north now and we'll have a series of rooms to inspect. First up is the
left door. This room leads to the kitchen. In here you want to inspect the
refrigerator to find some "surprise meat". Check it out to see what it is
(also important for later... it isn't pretty...).

 Onto the next door! Second from the left. This room is the bathroom, and
you can nab an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] from the medical supplies box. The third
door here (third from the left) is a door you can hear Marta in. Sounds like
she is with some new initiates. DO NOT go in here yet. Choose to walk away
for now... we'll get to her soon, I promise.

 Time for the last, far right door. This leads to the garage that the Park
Ranger mentioned earlier. You can examine the van here for some memories from
Glory, but since we helped out the Park Ranger earlier there is also a vent
to examine. Doing so will give you [_PREMIUM MEDKIT_] x2 (SWEET!) and a
[_BUMONA GOLD TRAUMA KIT_]. A very nice reward for saving someone from being
sliced up.

 One more room to go check before we meet back up with Marta. Head down from
the garage (along the right hallway) and check out the left wall room. Your
are told about this being the lounge by Glory, and you can tell there are
people inside here as well. Save up and heal if you are hurt at all (just in
case) and get ready for another battle as we're going to clear this room out:


  Fight: Taking the Foyer
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This battle is essentially the same as the one with the two alcolytes from
earlier, only there are three this time. That is definitely going to be a
pain, because again, these alcolytes get the first turn and are all likely
going to get in cover AND THEN shoot at you with their acid bolt spell. A
lucky critical can really dampen this fight, but that's why I had you save
earlier. You are reading these warnings, right!?

 Apart from the odd-critical hit you want to do what you always do here:
Adrenaline Boost with Glory and focus down one enemy at a time. My Rigger
gets to stay outside the room while sending two drones in, so he's rather
lucky but if your going ranged there's various cover options here. With any
luck they'll focus on the beefy Glory and you can wipe an enemy out quickly,
making the fight more manageable. Still, these mage type enemies are rather
weak so this isn't exactly a tough fight at all.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the fight, you'll actually get an optional objective here:


  o Objective (OPTIONAL): Investigate Picture


 The picture is on the right-hand wall so go over and check it out to see a
picture of some red-haired girls, one of who looks awfully familiar. Glory!
Glory will come over and check it out as you find (and take... TAKE IT!)
[_GLORY'S RING_]. Did Marta keep it as a memento, or is this just random?
Either way, it is important later.

 In my original run through this area I actually just now went and checked
the objective door, but learned it was locked so I ended up typing it up
above. So that only leaves confronting Marta left now. Head to her room and
enter. You won't find here, but you will see three scared initiates. Here you
have an easy out by using the [ETIQUETTE: STREET] dialog option, but you can
also just tell them that you are friends of Harrow. Either way they will let
you be. You can talk to the blue-haired female initiate as well for some good
dialog. Heh...

 Get ready as we're about to confront Marta. This whole sequence can go one
of two ways. The way I prepared you for will have you talking Marta through
what she has done. This is mainly triggered by "Glory's Ring" which let's you
convince Glory that Marta may not be a bad person deep down.

 Use the logical choices here to talk some sense into Marta (which includes
an [ETIQUETTE: ACADEMIC] option if you can use it). Talk about the manifesto
we read in detail, then talk about the lounge. After that, talk about how the
kids themselves are in danger.  Bring up the lounge shirt, the meat that you
found, and the Trid Player. All of these things combined should let you talk
Marta down and instead of giving you her key she will just flat-out join you:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Keep Marta Safe


 NOTE: The alternative here is to just let Glory do what she initially wanted
       to do: let her kill Marta. This starts a 2 vs. 1 fight here that you
       would really have to try and lose (so no battle box for Marta). After
       you kill her, you will get her ward.


 With Marta in tow, head to the special door and have her let you in. Glory
will prepare us as well, giving us a special ointment to let us confront the
spirit in its native realm and a necklace to ward off the evil.


 NOTE: This is a FINAL decision point for this mission. Stick with rescuing
       the initiates or focus on killing Harrow? For the purpose of this guide
       I am sticking with rescuing the initiates, but if you want a more...
       spotty outcome and (from what I've read) more damage for your claws,
       go after Harrow. Saving the initiates will end up netting Glory a
       healing ability. In the end this is your choice, but I greatly prefer
       the "Save the Initiate" story line...


 Continue on to the shrine room and soon you will be transported to the spirit
realm. We will soon be in a series of fights, so be ready and follow the battle
box below to see what you are up against. They begin once you advance to the
next area from where you end up.


  Fight: Fighting our way through Hell...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This first battle is against a Seeker and a Stalker, who will get the first
no matter what. Worst comes to worse they will get in a lucky hit, but it is
a small probability. If your MC is squishy (like mine), send him to cover
fast! Have Glory adrenaline herself up and charge. Focus on the Seeker if you
can as he has less HP to really even the odds and then move onward to a second
fight when you are ready.

 This battle has more cover to the left that you can get to right away, but
also has THREE enemies to worry about. Two Seekers and a Stalker. Thankfully,
the Stalker is at the FAR END of the area and will take forever to get to
us, so use that time to try and take out the two Seekers as fast as you can.
You should be able to kill them both with some luck by the time he reaches
you, but kill one at the very least to make the fight even.

 The next room leads into the fight against the spirit, so heal up before
you go on. Best to be ready!


 Head forward and you will soon meet the spirit, the "Heart of Feuerstelle".
This spirit will recognize Glory and offers her Harrow and the kids just to
remove the ward from around her neck. Fat chance of that. You can get in some
dialog here if you wish, but Glory reminds you to not engage. Still, we have
little choice here but to refuse the offers the spirit makes, starting a fight
soon.


 This fight is a bit tougher than the other ones, but still not bad. The
Spirit will split into three copies, and only one is the real one. The other
two deal MUCH LESS damage and disappear if you attack them. Once you find the
real one though, he won't change so just attack until you get him, then keep
your eyes on him as he re-summons any copies you destroyed. For his part, the
"Heart of Feuerstelle" hits hard but is spotty on accuracy. His clones hit
weakly and are REALLY bad at hitting you. Be ready for an emergency med kit
and you'll be OK.

 During the second round, a man will materialize during the fight. It is
Harrow! There will be some dialog here of course, but he will soon join as
an enemy. He is a rather average mage and will materialize each round as
well, so focus on the Feuerstelle and soon the battle will be over.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the battle go ahead and let Glory do what she is going to do. If you
are following the "Save the Initiates" path that I am, you can trust the
spirits' will to make things right. Oh, we got some objectives as well:


 o Objective: Defeat and Purify the Spirit Shrine

 o Objective: Save the Freed Cult Members


 Once you leave the spirit realm we'll have to find the kids. Head to the
right and clear the rubble you find. You'll find the kids in the lounge, so
go get them and book it out of this place before it comes down on your heads!



 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You thread your way through the trees of the Schonbuch Forest, tracing
    your way back to the thicket where you and Glory hid the van. The inferno
    that consumed Feurstelle is spreading, and the conflagration casts the
    forest around you in a sinister orange light.

    The heat at your back is intense. Unbearable. Far ahead, Glory blazes a
    trail for you to follow, shredding the foliage in her path. Marta
    shepherds the shellshocked initiates along behind you, doing what she
    can to keep them calm and moving.

    The fire is moving fast, but you're faster. As Marta helps the last of the
    kids into the van, you put the vehicle in gear and punch the accelerator.
    The burning ruin of Feuerstelle recedes into the distance, a glowing speck
    in the rear-view mirror. The peace and safety of the Kreuzbasar lie ahead.



 Once you get back to The Kreuzbasar, you'll get a small karma bump:

 (KARMA GAINED: 2)

 You can go talk to Glory now and re-cap the mission with her and earn a
Steam Achievement as well:


 NOTE: Talking to Glory will complete her personal mission and nets you the
       "Moving On" Steam Achievement. Congrats!


 Next up, go ahead and "Post Harrow's Bribe Records" on the Shadowland BBS
for some extra money coming up.


 NOTE: Having [CHARISMA: 4] will net you a free Karma Point in this upcoming
       mission. Is it worth spending karma to get? Not this late in the game,
       but as always the choice is yours...

       ALSO,  VERY IMPORTANT!!!  , you want to have a great hacker for this
       next mission. It can get you out of a lot of fighting, make the mission
       VERY easy, and net you a free Karma Point as well. Be sure to buff up
       your hacker a bit and get them the latest programs in order to get them
       in and out with ease.


 Nothing left to do now but move on to the next mission. We are approaching
the end-game at this point, in case you couldn't tell. Soon we'll have enough
money for Alice no matter WHAT and we'll be in the last few missions. But for
now, a final job. Head to the U-Bahn and select:


 "Assemble the team and travel to the OTK International offices to tap Knight
  Errant communications, in preperation for your run against Aztechnology."

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ OTK International is a small-time software developer, and it shows. The
    company's main office is crammed up against the back wall of a massive
    shared office park, surrounded by competing businesses and larger
    corporations. A steady trickle of dead-eyed wageslaves flows in and out
    of the complex.

    The office park's main entrance is overflowing with hired security, but
    your forged keycard gets you past them easily enough. A few minutes later,
    you're walking the winding corridors toward OTK International.

    You're only a few smashed computers away from putting Amsel's plan into
    motion.



 We start this mission alone, as we infiltrated the main office and need to
let our team in through the side door. We'll get our objectives and then be
free to continue:


 o Objective: Destroy the Commlink Software

 o Objective: Reunite with  Your Team


 Head forward and you'll get a message about an employee being engrossed in
his work. We have several options on what to do here, but a few can get us
some free karma.

 You can of course choose to ignore him and continue on, but we need stuff
in the room past him, so choose to either sneak or approach him. If you sneak
you can get a [QUICKNESS: 4] option to hide when he turns around, but if you
just address him you can use [CHARISMA: 4] to talk him out of any confrontation
and let him leave naturally. This will net you:

 (KARMA GAINED: 1)

 You can also launch yourself at him. If you do this you are given a whole
HOST of options, including [CLOSE COMBAT: 4], [SPELL: MANABOLT] or [SPELL:
STUNBOLT]. Any of these will take him out, but just choosing to wrestle him
will take him out to (although killing him).


 NOTE: Thanks to Reader Tim Wilfong, I can confirm that taking out this
       employee with [CLOSE COMBAT: 4] does indeed also grant you a
       bonus of (KARMA GAINED: 1). Thanks Tim!


 Once you deal with him, go ahead and continue down the hallway for now, just
ignoring the doors on the upper path. Take the upper left door to see a sort
of storage room. You can let your team in from here. Go ahead and do so.

 Once you get back inside, a janitor will come and stop you. Here you need
to convince the janitor you aren't out of place. If you happen to have the
[ETIQUETTE: CORPORATE] etiquette, this is an easy task. However, you can get
through this without it. Just start off by mentioning you are a friend of
the boss (which she doesn't buy), then admit to lying. Tell the janitor you
got your work clothes dirty by "standing close to each other" and then ask
if she wants you to change back into them. Finally, nod at her and you'll
get away scott-free! Either of these options nets you:

 (KARMA GAINED: 1)

 Head back down the hallway and to the room where you took the man out and
head left to the boss's room. Check out his desk. "Mr. Steven Williams". You
can check out his wall art and white board if you wish (Note the calender has
the date "June 29th" circled on it multiple times), but his desk is really
the only thing of interest here.

 You'll find one of the drawers locked here. You can examine it further if
you have [INTELLIGENCE: 3] (which honestly just doesn't help that much and
tells you that you can open it via the terminal), or you can just outright
break it if you have [STRENGTH: 5]. That will open the drawer.

 If you can't do that, go ahead and leave it alone. You can turn on the
terminal now and hack it if you have [DECKING: 5]. This will immediately open
the drawer as well. If none of these are an option, you can choose to try and
log in. This is actually a "multiple choice" type question. First you have to
choose the username, which should be "swilliams" and next the password, which
will be "0629", which you were supposed to get from the nearby calender.

 Any of these things will let you open up the drawer, and inside you will
find our reward: the [_SUPERVISOR'S ID BADGE_]. This will let us bluff our
way inside.


 Now, there are a number of ways to do the rest of this mission. We can go
guns blazing or we can not fight at all. Personally, I'm going to have you
go through the sneakiest route (we get the same karma either way). This is
why we brought the decker along!


 The SNEAKY Route
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 With the badge in our possession, head to the hallway and go into the upper
right room. The two drones will let you by after seeing your badge, so head
in and you'll be stopped by the guards. Show them your badge and they'll let
you be.

 NOTE: It is recommended you SAVE here... just in case...

 From here, just have your decker jack-in to the middle computer in the area
and we'll begin our all-important matrix dive:



 o NET INFILTRATION: OTK International Central Database
 |
 |
 |  This is a rather long matrix section, and we MUST make sure we don't get
 | caught while we're in here. Suppression is a good skill to bring along,
 | but even better is killing off enemies FAST.
 |
 |  The starting area has three IC at the start that show up once you make
 | the turn into the big area. Take them out ASAP (Blaster can be helpful
 | here) and then head north. Two IC show up once the first three are almost
 | dead, so take them out as well and head north to the next area.
 |
 |  You'll see two IC and a Sparky up here. The IC will rush you, so take
 | them out and move up the right-hand side. Another IC will spawn as you
 | move forward, so take it out and then the Sparky. Note that the left side
 | of this area has another IC that will spawn, but we don't want to fight it
 | so ignore it and only use the right side. Interact with the node up here
 | and you will destroy the Commlink Software, completing our goal in this
 | mission and giving us a new objective:
 |
 |
 | o Objective: Escape
 |
 |
 |  Head back down, taking the right path and heading right when you get back
 | to the first big room. We got one more stop to make, but as long as we're
 | killing things fast we can make it. Head right and two IC will pop up. Take
 | them both out and head into the right area.
 |
 |  Here you'll face three more IC. Take them out one at a time quickly and
 | head forward, hacking the "Financial Data Server" node here to gain the
 | [_PAYDATA: OTK FINANCIAL DATA_]. This also gives us (KARMA GAINED: 1).
 |
 |  That is all we have to do, so head back to the entrance and jack-out.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 NOTE: If you get caught in this MATRIX section, you will be forced to fight.
       See the below route for info on enemies and the battle ahead.


 After jacking out, you merely need to head to the exit and we are done with
this mission. Easy!


 The BRUTE FORCE Route
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This route is more about going in loud, but can also benefit from a small
bit of optional hacking. There's a few ways to do this, as usual.

 If you want to unlock a shortcut to the exit, from the janitor you can head
up and you'll be in an office. Here you can jack in to unlock the nearby
"Executive Door" to the right:


 o NET INFILTRATION: OTK International Executive Database
 |
 |
 |  Unlike the database above, this one is short and sweet. It will pit you
 | up against two IC and a sparky, but once you take them both out you can
 | hack the "Executive Door" node and unlock it to open up a shortcut.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 From here you can enter the room with the guards. Show them your ID to get
in a good position. There's a few ways you can do this of course, including
having someone hack the central computer (See above for that), but if you are
going brute force, head to the upper right door. Try to enter it and the guard
will warn you away. Attack them at this point:



  Fight: Taking out the servers manually...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 You will start the fight with the two guards in the room you are in as well
as the two drones from the lower right room. These drones are rather weak
and should be taken out first if you can, but focus on the skinny-ish guard
as well to kill him off and get him to drop the [_SERVER ROOM DOOR KEY_].

 With the key in our possession, we have more options. First, we can open the
upper left room in order to get to the "Drone Control" console. From here, you
can have a drone user use the [DRONE CONTROL: 4] option to shut the drones down
or the [DRONE CONTROL: 6] option to have them target enemies. Note that this
ONLY applies to the three drones to the north, not the drone reinforcements or
the drones that start the fight (which is why you may as well kill them off
like I mentioned). Shut them down if you can or ignore the room if you don't
have a drone control user.

 More importantly, head to the upper right door once you get the key. Send
someone like Glory (with her Adrenaline shot) to open the door but also send
Eiger to overlook it from afar, as once you open it, FOUR enemies will show
up. One is a rigger. Take him out first if you can, but Glory and Eiger should
be able to kill off an enemy here, thinning out their numbers.

 Once they head into the room, leave them to your character, Dietrich and
Eiger (Eiger's new mid-range rifle SHINES here). Have Glory open up the door
to the right (the server room) and destroy all three servers here, letting
the drones take shots at her (she can take it), then destroying the drones.
If the enemies group up, have Eiger use her AP grenade, but thin their
numbers until Glory runs out.

 With the servers destroyed, you will get the final objective:


o Objective: Escape


 Go ahead and start retreating, stopping behind cover when you can as you
head north. Thanks to the shortcut we opened up earlier, this will cut down
on the number of turns it takes to escape. Once you've left, the battle and
the mission as a whole will be complete.


 NOTE: Enemies don't really stop for a number of turns. You'll get more
       guards, riggers and drones coming in from the south and north if you
       stick around and fight, so BE SURE to prioritize destroying the
       actual servers and escaping over all things.

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The U-Bahn ride home is smooth and uneventful. The high-ups at OTK
    International must be scrambling to try and recover their losses. It's
    only a matter of time before they make the call and Amsel's compromised
    data is uploaded to Knight Errant's commlinks.

    You're going to be rolling into Aztechnology with one hell of an
    advantage. Not bad for a night's work...


 Once we are back home, you will gain a karma reward as usual. Kind-of a
small one this time, but better than nothing. We get an objective as well:


 (KARMA GAINED: 4)

 o Objective: Talk to Amsel


 Go ahead and to talk to Paul now (note that none of your teammates really
have anything to say about the last mission - they treat this as a side
mission, to be honest).

 Paul will tell you about the run coming up, how he has his ear in the comm.
systems now and will be able to advise you. He also mentions that the client
has added our voice to the basement door, as well as that medevac is NOT
available, so we can't let anyone die (bring along those medkits you have
been saving... or buy some). We get our new objective here:


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to Aztechnology's Berlin Compound


 Finally, go check out the Shadowland BBS to receive your payment for the
Harrow Bribes paydata we put up earlier: [_270 NUYEN_].

 All that is left now is to head to the U-Bahn and head to the next mission
(unless you want to buy some medical supplies - note that the vendors haven't
updated their stocks in awhile).


 NOTE: In the next mission, having [CHARISMA: 4] will help us out a TON, as
       I pointed out long before. In short, it saves us from a LOT of fights
       in the upcoming mission. You have it.... right?


 Head to the U-Bahn and select:


 "Assemble the team and travel to Aztechnology's Berlin compound to sabotage
  their "Bloodline" research project".


 Time to begin the next mission.

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Aztechnology. A giant in the worlds of technological and magical
    research. One of the most powerful - and feared - corporations on the
    planet. There are very few places in this world what the tendrils of
    Aztechnology cannot reach.

    Germany is no exception. The black glass edifice of an Azzie pyramid
    dominates the courtyard of the Zitadelle Spandau. And countless other,
    more innocuous facilities can be found all over Berlin.

    The lab that they maintain in the Jewuhl District is one of these.
    According to your client, the project that the Azzies are working on
    here is dangerous.

    So dangerous that she's paying you to bring the entire building down.



 Our job is to bring the building DOWN. Oh boy, this is going to be fun. The
team will comment on the district and the poor wageslaves before we are given
our objectives:


 o Objective: Get Inside the Aztechnology Facility

 o Objective: Overload the Facility's Generator

 o Objective: Keep the Team Alive


 Interact with the terminal on your lower left to see the markings of the
Schockwellenreiter. They want us to uncover and share project data from this
run, giving us an optional objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Get the Project Data for the Schockwellenreiter


 Continue south and soon you'll get a message from the Lodge. They want us
speak a certain phrase to an executive. "We are pleased that Project Vincent
is going so well." Sounds simple enough:


  o Objective (OPTIONAL): Give the Message to the Aztechnology Executive


 This run looks like it's going to be action-packed from here. Head south
and before the main entrance Paul will ring you up on comm. and tell you to
try and do things stealthily and we can avoid the emergency response team.
Look for an alternate route.

 Well, as always things are up to you, but I'll be guiding us through as
easily as I can. Head south from the entrance and you'll notice a path to the
north and south. Head south first and you'll see a closed Soykaf shop. Past
that is a couple. Head up to them to hear them talk.

 Seems one of their friends is trying to tap Aztechnology's power reserves,
using the hatch here. Talk to Mira once they are done talking and tell them
you will help, gaining the [_UTILITY HATCH ACCESS CARD_] and an objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Enter the Utility Tunnel and Find Danni


 Go ahead and enter the hatch to continue on. Head forward a ways and you
will see a girl cornered by some drones. Go ahead and take both of them out
now. They are weak and definitely don't deserve a battle box, but killing
them off gives you a karma reward:


 (KARMA GAINED: 1)


 Danni will thank you and you'll see the tap that she has put up. Eiger will
note that you can OVERLOAD the Aztechnology building's power from here if you
wanted to, but Danni is sure that will bring them down on her and her friends
if you do.


 You have a choice to make here. It honestly boils down to whether or not you
can pass some other skill checks OR if you want to go in fighting. Simply put,
if you can't pass a [DECKING: 4] skill check followed by either a [CHARISMA: 5]
or a [STRENGTH: 6] skill check, I would overload the power here. Tell Danni you
are sorry and do what you have to do.


 NOTE: The rest of the guide for this mission assumes you TAKE THE POWER DOWN,
       as it is what I ended up having to do to get inside without being
       noticed. Just FYI.


 IDEALLY, you can pass those up above and then we'll have another path into
the building, but if you can't, overload the power here. When you leave, you
will have some dialog from Danni's friends, giving you some [CHARISMA: 5] and
[ETIQUETTE: STREET] dialog choices. Or just tell them to leave.

 From here, just head up the side of the building to see the worker and a
guard arguing. They won't pay attention to you, so enter the building. DO NOT
talk to them though.



 BEGIN OPTIONAL PATH:


  If you can get away with it, do the above and DO NOT overload the generator.
 Instead, head north from this area and up the side of the building. You will
 see an "LTG Worker" here that you can interact with.

  Go ahead and talk to her and use your [DECKING: 4] option to help her out.
 From there you will have the [CHARISMA: 5] and [STRENGTH: 6] options that were
 mentioned earlier to get her to leave. From here the side entrance is open to
 you and you can get inside.



 Inside Aztechnology (Side Door)
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The glittering halls of the Aztechnology facility stand in sharp
    contrast to the megacorp's unsavory reputation. Everything in here
    screams "money", from the mirror-poolish on the floors to the obsidian
    inlays in the walls.

    The generators - and the Bloodline project - lie somewhere beneath
    your feet.


 Paul rings you up on comms. to tell you that you are inside undetected, and
about an elevator we can use to get to the objective. We are reminded about
the executive here as well for some reason.

 Be sure to SAVE here.

 Head forwards and you can see we can go left or right. Head right and open
the door, then go SLOWLY forward to see a guard pacing to the right. He will
go into the hallway and back south. When he goes south, continue past him and
to the north, stopping at the terminal you can jack-in at. No one can see you
right here. Go ahead and jack-in.


 o NET INFILTRATION: Aztechnology Foyer
 |
 |
 |  This matrix run is pretty simple. It consists of one giant area once
 | you get to it, guarded by some easy IC. Barely worth writing about, but I
 | wanted to point out that you can hack THREE nodes here, from clockwise:
 | the "Security Cameras", "Secure Door Controls" and finally the "Elevator
 | Controls". Everything is absolutely NECESSARY here, so hit them all and
 | jack out when you can.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 The reason we went to this terminal will now become very clear: we can open
up the nearby security door now to find a locker that has a key to avoiding
fights from here on in: the [_KNIGHT ERRANT UNIFORMS_].

 All that warning about having [CHARISMA: 4] comes into play now and starts
to reward us: you can run into any of the two guards patrolling this floor
now and they will stop you, but with your uniform on you can now use either
the [CHARISMA: 4] option or the [ETIQUETTE: SECURITY] option to get out of a
fight, giving you free reign of this floor.

 The first thing we should do is head up, talking our way past the elevator
guard and then heading to the northwest room where you will see an executive
hanging out. This is the objective for The Lodge and is easy and painless to
do. Go ahead and talk to the man and whisper what you need to to him, then
leave him be. This completes our objective.

 Now, the next thing to do is head south through the door, which leads us
back to where we came from. Head into the left room now to interact with a
terminal. If you have [DECKING: 4] here, you can get a very easy paydata from
this terminal: [_PAYDATA: DNA "DONOR" LIST_].


 That's all we have to do on this floor. Now it is as simple as heading north
and entering the elevator, continuing on to the bowels of this building in
order to bring it down.



 Inside Aztechnology (Lower Floor)
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your stomach lurches slightly as the elevator plummets downward, into
    the bowels of the Aztechnology facility. A faint but omnipresent thrumming
    sound raises the hair on the back of your neck.

    The deeper you go, the more certain you become: this place is vibrating
    with power, both from the generators, and from... something else.


 As you get out of the elevator, Paul will commend you once again for being
able to get this far without any security alarms being set off. Not bad, if
I say so myself. We get an objective here as well:


 o Objective: Escape Through the Security Door


 Step out of the elevator and you'll get stopped by a guard. They'll ask you
who you are, but point out the uniform (nicely!) and you'll get the same set
of choices that we did up above in order to bypass this fight, by using either
[ETIQUETTE: SECURITY] or [CHARISMA: 4]. Go ahead and get out of this fight and
continue on.


                                             .------------------------------.
 As you continue on, Paul will message       |   Aztec Gods for Passwords   |
you and gives you the [_AZTECHNOLOGY ADMIN   |------------------------------|
PASSWORD_] which is "Xolotl" (see the side   | "Xolotl" isn't just a weird  |
bar for why this is fitting... once you see  | combo of letters, it is a    |
the lab it gets even better...).             | reference to an Aztec God.   |
                                             | Xolotl is the Aztec God of   |
 Continue on to see the room to the lab,     | lightning and death, fitting |
with the door locked. Guards come out soon   | for the password of the lab. |
and look relieved to see us, as they were    '------------------------------'
all waiting on relief. Once again, [ETIQUETTE: SECURITY] and/or [CHARISMA: 4]
saves our butts here, as you can talk your way out of another fight once again
which you should do. They will head toward the elevator shortly after that.


 Now, we have to open up the lab door, which means a matrix run for us. The
jack-in is to the lower right, so take your decker over there and jack in.


 o NET INFILTRATION: Lab Door Access Point
 |
 |
 |  This is a fairly short matrix run, especially if you are following this
 | guide. Start by going through the door to the south (southeast). Here you
 | will face three white IC and a sparky. Take them out one at a time, which
 | will limit the number of enemies gunning for you and then you can hack the
 | "Lab Blast Door" to the southeast.
 |
 |  Head back to the first area and head southwest. You'll see two paths
 | down this way, one door to the left and one to the right. The right path
 | is the ONLY one worth going to. There are two white IC for you to fight
 | down here but you can hack the "Security Cameras" node as well, so you may
 | as well.
 |
 |  If you were wondering, the left path also has you fighting two white IC
 | but has a "Facility Operations Records" node you can hack. This doesn't do
 | anything for us though. Perhaps because we got the paydata earlier? Not
 | 100% sure about that though, but it does save us a trip. Head back to the
 | starting area and jack-out.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 With the path open, we can head forward past the doors to the huge room.
Continue down the hallway to the "Biometric Scanner", which is something that
Paul warned us about. Go ahead and interact with it to get into the lab and
interrupt the people at work.

 These... let's say "people" are actually blood mages. You'll have a small
chat with the head one, where you'll get the [BRIGHTLIGHT SYSTEM CYBEREYE]
option to blind him. This gets you in the fight below though, although we
aren't getting out of this fight no matter what so if you have it you may as
well use it.

 If you don't have that (who does!?!), the blood mage will suggest another
way of figuring out who you are, and starts some blood magic. This isn't good
of course, but if you have [QUICKNESS: 6] you can attack before he finishes.
Barring that though, you have no choice but to let him finish.

 Once he is done, we have a number of ways to resist him, although many of
them depend on your own magic abilities. You can use [ADEPT POWER: MAGIC
RESISTANCE] to deflect the spell, the [ADEPT POWER: PAIN RESISTANCE] ability
to ignore the pain or finally [BODY: 6] to suffer through the pain.


 NOTE: (777 SELF NOTE): I've read that if you can resist the spell here,
                        you can then use [CHARISMA: 4] to lie about being
                        security, but can't confirm this for myself at this
                        time.


 If you can't resist, you will end up in a battle here:


  Fight: Taking out the servers manually...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As the battle starts, you will be told:

 "19 turns before high threat response team arrives".

 That is a LOT of time, so we should have no worries. What is more important
is that our group is clustered up together and is easy marks for the mages
and their AoE spells. Spread out quickly, but be ready with a heal for whoever
took the worst of it (Dietrich is healing and putting Aim on Eiger on this
first round, likely).

 Take out the blood mages one at a time, starting with the one in the open
and then take out whoever is left. While your team is taking them out, your
decker should IMMEDIATELY go for the jack-in point (see below).


 As far as actual fighting goes, there is very little left for the rest of
our team to do. There is a terminal across from the jack-in point but only
the main character can do it. You can also interact with the prisoners, once
your decker "frees" them below, but again only the main character can do
anything with them. It is also worth noting that there is a SPIRIT SHRINE
in the main room, just north of the jack-in spot, where Dietrich can summon
an Apocalypse spirit, but it is overkill if this is your first battle. If it
isn't and you have enemies coming down the hallway, by all means summon him
and send him down into the hallway.


 You should also head north and take out the two guards by the generator
console. Just take them out for now and then chill while your decker does
his work. DO NOT start the countdown quite yet.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 With the fighting and matrix sections going on (See below for the matrix
walk-throughs, you won't have much to do if your main character is also your
decker (like mine is).

 Once they are freed up though (or... once your decker finishes his job if
he isn't your main character) we will have some stuff to do. After you get
the terminal unlocked, you can check it for several options, which include
[ETIQUETTE: ACADEMIC] to analyze the language, [INTELLIGENCE: 5] to attempt
to decipher the language and IMPORTANTLY, you can COPY the date. Doing this
will give you the [_PROJECT BLOODLINE FILES_].

 Also, once your decker opens a cell door you get the objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Free the Test Subjects


 This can only be done by your main character, so get them over there when
you are able to to talk to them. You will get a LOT of insight into what
exactly is going on during this project. I can see why we were hired for
this job. Tell the clones whatever you wish to tell them and you'll get some
karma for your troubles:


 (KARMA GAINED: 3)


 At this point you should have your Decker go take out the matrix section by
the exit (right of the Generator Controls) to clear our escape for us. While
he is doing that, you can have someone else on your team mess with the
Generator Controls nearby to start the melt down. Disable the security controls
first (remember, the password is Xolotl ) and then overload the generator. We
have NINE turns to exit at this point, so finish up your second matrix run here
and get everyone to the exit!


 And now for the matrix section:


 o NET INFILTRATION: Project "Bloodlines" Network
 |
 |
 |  Another fairly short matrix section, but with several stops that we need
 | to hit along the way. We start out with paths to the right, north and left
 | so let's go right first.
 |
 |  Here you'll fight two white IC and then you can hack the "Eastern Cell
 | Door". Head back once you've done that and go north next. Two more white
 | IC to fight and you can open the "Northern Cell Door". Easy enough, but
 | note the left path from here. Take it to run into two more white IC and a
 | Sparky. Take them out and follow the path, then kill one more IC that you
 | find and you can now hack the "Bloodline Terminal Access Node". This will
 | open up the terminal across from the jack-in point for us a bit later (or
 | if you are using Blitz, I imagine you can have your main character check it
 | now if you wish).
 |
 |  Head back to the main hub and enter the left door last. It is back to the
 | basic white IC, so kill them off and open up the "Western Cell Door". Head
 | back to the hub now and jack-out.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 o NET INFILTRATION: Security Door Exit
 |
 |
 |  This area is short and sweet and shouldn't take you anywhere near the
 | nine turns the generator will take to explode. Head forward and on the
 | next screen you'll have to kill two white IC. Take them out and hack the
 | "Security Access Door" to open up the exit.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 With the exit open, all that is left to do should be to leave, so send
everyone to the exit to get out of this area.



 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Memories of the explosion that toppled the Aztechnology facility keep
    you company on your ride back to the Kreuzbasar. You barely managed to
    outrun the blast. Now the facility lies buried under thousands of
    kilograms of twisted rebar and reinforced concrete, no doubt a
    considerable blow to Aztechnology's activities here in Berlin.

    Mission successful. It's time to get paid.


 Once we get back home, we will get our karma reward and a TON of objectives
that are mainly focused on WHAT we are doing with our data...


 (KARMA GAINED: 12)


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Notify Luca Duerr that his task is complete.

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Return the Data to the Schockwellenreiter Payphone

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Find someone to Decipher the Aztechnology Data

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Decide what to do with the Aztechnology Data


 First thing's first: visit Luca at the Cafe Cezve to tell him you talked to
the Exec for a cool [_1,000 NUYEN_]. Even though that executive is likely
buried in rubble... hehehe.

 Head back home now. Here, BE SURE to talk to Blitz who will tell you what
happened with his search for Emile. Things will advance here even further,
as you both find out she was part of the Schockwellenreiter. Gah. Poor Blitz
should have left well enough alone after all, but at least he knows...


 NOTE: Talking to Blitz right here should net you the "Relationship Counselor"
       STEAM Achievement. Congrats!


 Talk to the rest of your team now if you wish (save Paul for now) for their
thoughts on the last run, then go check your computer. You should have one
new message at this point, a message from the Schockwellenreiter about a
reward for helping them throughout the game, some new cyberware, and to "go
see Dr. Ezkibel". Free is free! Also, go ahead and claim payment for the
Aztechnology sabotage run, which will net you [_6,000 NUYEN_] as a personal
payment. Not bad, right?

 Next up, view the Alice Funds section and choose to "Transfer 50,000 Nuyen
to Alice's secured credstick for payment". The computer will tell you that
you need to see Paul before you do so. Go ahead and drop off, then talk to
Paul. While you are talking to him, you can ask about analyzing the Bloodline
data, and he will tell you to go talk to Aljernon. Tell him you are ready for
the Alice run now and you'll get a dialog warning you that once we start this,
ALL SIDE JOBS and uncompleted missions will be cancelled. No worries, we have
done everything we can do, so agree with him and he'll give you the mission
item [_ALICE FUND AUTHORIZATION_], telling you the password is "Volklingen".

 Go back to the computer and move the 50,000 Nuyen to the credstick, which
will make you put in the password and ends up giving you a new objective:


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to Meet Alice


  If you've been following this guide word for word, you should also now have
the remaining money in the account. This should add a whopping [_8,000 NUYEN_]
to your account. Very nice!

 Next up, hit up the Shadowland BBS and claim your payment for the OTK
financial records for [_441 NUYEN_]. Next, post the date for ONLY the
"Aztechnology DNA donor list". DO NOT POST THE OTHER ONE!


 Excellent, next we'll take care of the Bloodline data. If you want some
extra dialog, go see Aljernon at the magic shop about the Bloodline data
for a more in-depth lesson on what was going on during the last run. He will
recommend we destroy it, but for the sake of karma I disagree.

 Instead, head to the northwest payphone and deliver the data to the
Schockwellenreiter. Doing so will net you [_500 NUYEN_] and a karma reward:


 (KARMA GAINED: 2)

 NOTE: If you turn in the Bloodline Data to the Schockwellenreiter, you will
       get the "Information is Free" STEAM Achievement. Congrats!


 Very nice. One last thing we can do for now. If you wish, you can visit the
doctor's shop in the northeast and shop his cyberware for a free "Adrenal
Contractor" if you wish, courtesy of the Schockwellenreiter. It even costs
zero essence, but depending on your build it may not benefit you too much.

 So... no new items in the shops to buy and "Level 6" for our allies is still
locked, so as you may guess we still have a few missions left to do. We are
definitely approaching end game though, don't worry.


 For now, head to the U-Bahn and choose to:


 "Travel to the "Rabbit Hole" at the Altstadt Spandau U-Bahn station to
  retrieve Alice's data."

        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The tiny credstick feels heavy in your pocket, fat with the weight of
    hard-won nuyen. The U-Bahn station swallows you up and sends you hurtling
    down the rabbit hole. Towards Alice. Towards the information you've bled
    for.

    The train pulls to a stop and the doors hiss open to the dark, old
    platform.

    With luck, answers lie ahead.



 Time to go get our informations from Alice. A simple task, right? Well...
things can go awfully wrong, awfully fast, so don't expect this to be a very
short chapter:


 o Objective: Retrieve Alice's Information


 Still, not much can get in our way of interacting with the arcade machine,
so go ahead and put in the credstick. You will get a warning from Alice after
this telling you to RUN and not to look for Dr. Vauclair, but still giving you
the [_OPTICAL CHIP_] with allthe info Alice found.


 Head back ti the U-Bahn train and soon you'll get... a very distressing PDA
call. Just... just watch.

 Wow... the Firewing is serious. We are being hunted, and you can expect to
be ambushed as soon as you get back to the kiev. Get ready!


 Surprisingly, we are NOT being ambushed right away. Instead, Eiger took up
a post at the U-Bahn platform once she figured out what was going on (Paul
had the whole team patched in to prepare them... one last sacrifice). VERY
smart, as she deduced that the enemy would target the train to cut off any
potential escape AND kill us as we were coming back. BOOM, you can't beat
Eiger! So, we team up with our muscle but need to save the rest of the team.
If it is any consolation, we get an AP boost here as well:


  "+1 Action Point! Your experience has increased your ability to operate
    in dangerous situations."


 o Objective: Find Glory

 o Objective: Find Dietrich

 o Objective: The Team Must Survive


 Once you are ready, head outside and we'll get into a fight:


  Fight: Finding our Allies
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As the battle starts, you'll see some guards get in place while one of them
is just DEVASTATED by a hell-hound. Wow. Well, we may as well help the thing
right!?

 Focus on the nearly-dead mage in the back to make this on 3 vs. 2 fight and
then focus on the smaller guard to take them out first (they have less HP
than the giant troll). They may run south, so you'll likely have to send
Eiger forwards a bit to get in range of them if the dog doesn't take them out
first. Still, this is an easy fight and once they die we'll get some dialog.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the battle, you'll meet the dog face-to-face... it is Dante? How in
the world did THIS happen. Apparently one of the guards winged him and made
him MAD. Drew out the latent power, it appears.

 You get a couple of options here, including a [SPELLCASTING/CONJURING]
options to read his aura or a [WILLPOWER: 4] option to tell him to come to
you. You don't need EITHER of these however, as if you've been friendly and
petting him after every mission, he will come take his place by your side
once he gets a good sniff of you. Just... touching. I'm literally smiling
like an idiot at this point.


 NOTE: Recruiting the hellhound to your side will net you the "DANTE'S
       INFERNO" STEAM achievement. Very nice!


 Head north now to reclaim Glory first. We'll get in a fight once we get
close enough:


  Fight: Never Corner the Girl in Chrome...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Glory is cornered by three enemies, but we now have them between us and
even better, as the fight starts, we get to go first with our main force
BEHIND the enemy (which means we bet a big fat flanking bonus).

 Start out by targetting the Conjurer to the far left. Less HP and we can
easily take them out in one turn, so no spirit to deal with. From there
just focus on whoever you want. Dante is a new ally, but he has some very
powerful magic. Try out his Petrify spell on an enemy if you want to get rid
of them for a round.

 During this fight, have Eiger hang back and snipe. Not only does she do
good damage with the sniper rifle, but at some point an enemy will come up
from behind and attack. Eiger being a target for them not only protects any
other squishier members but lets Eiger shotgun them for good damage once her
turn comes up. Just hope they don't get in criticals or else you may need to
use a medkit. Dante can come help with the lower enemy when they show up as
well. Overall, this is a fairly easy battle thanks to the flanking pincer
attack we find the enemy in.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Now time to head to Dietrich in the south. Come in from either the left or
the right, it shouldn't matter too much. Either direction gives Eiger a great
view with her sniper rifle. Once you get close enough, another battle will
start:


  Fight: Magic Unyielding
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Three more enemies to fight here, which should be a piece of cake as once
again Dietrich is being cornered by his enemies (meaning that you get in
some flanking pincer attacks once again.

 Start off with Eiger sniping the mage to the far right. You should be able
to kill them off rather easily. Next send Glory in and have Dietrich Haste
AND put Aim on her. Combine that with adrenaline and you have a killing
machine, although Dietrich will be somewhat exposed. You may even be able to
kill off another guard or at least use Dante to limit or erase their AP.

 After the next turn you'll get another enemy coming in from behind Dietrich,
much like the previous battle. He's not enough to turn the tide of this
battle though, so take the rest of the enemies out one by one and you'll gain
Dietrich again as a party member.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the battle, Dietrich will tell you that Blitz ran off to try and jam
the comm units of the attackers, but our biggest problem right now is to stop
the explosives being hooked up in the sewers, which gives us an objective:


 o Objective: Stop the Plot in the Sewers


 Heading northwest toward the sewers will get us into a short fight though,
so be ready. Hardly a fight though, so take them out:


  Fight: In the Gardens
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 You'll get in this fight on your way to the sewers, in the garden area of
the kiev. Three more enemies to fight, one of whom is a mage. Honestly no
big deal with the extra firepower that Dante brings.

 One thing of note here is that all three enemies are gathered together near
a door, meaning that any AoE abilities you have will be put to good use here,
so go with them if you can. Prioritize taking out the mage and then killing
the remaining enemies off one by one to put an end to this fight easily.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Head inside the sewers to continue on:


 Inside the Sewers
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You and your ream descend into the sewers, footsteps echoing off of the
    damp stone walls. You barely notice the smell - there's no time to waste.
    Audran's team of mercenaries is down here somewhere, racing to plant
    their explosive charges beneath the kiez.

    The fate of the Kreuzbasar is in your hands.


 We are IMMEDIATELY put into another fight once we enter the sewers:


  Fight: In the Gardens
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As you start this fight, you'll get two objectives right off the bat:


 o Objective: Deactivate All the Bombs

 o Objective: Kill All of the Mercenaries


 We also are told that we have 11 Rounds until the bombs explode, with 3
bombs being active (the mission markers show you what directions they can
be found in). This is a pretty easy objective given our advanced number of
party members.

 To start off, note that there is a bomb to the immediate left and to the
immediate right. We have so many party members though that we can split up
and attack both sides at once. Personally, I send Eiger and my main character
to the left while Dante, Glory and Dietrich go right. If you have Dietrich
buff Glory up and have her use Adrenaline, she can really move!

 As you send her right, note there is an enemy Mage in the room over here,
so take him out first and then send everyone south to wipe out the two guards
you find there.

 Your left group will reach the enemies a bit faster, just get into range and
kill them off one at a time. There are three guards up here to deal with,
fairly standard stuff although they may run off and spread out a bit (which
is a pain).


 NOTE: No matter which way you go, once you engage you will notice that there
       are NEUTRAL GHOULS helping you attack. There will be one attacking the
       left group and another attacking the right group. This is a DIRECT
       RESULT of you finding a peaceful solution for them earlier in the game
       so if you've been following this guide these fights will be that much
       easier for you.


 Once you defeat each group of enemies, hit the bombs and start sending your
team members up north ASAP. The one final bomb is past a door up here being
guarded by four enemies: two guards, a conjurer and a mage. If you have
someone strong reach the door first (Eiger/Glory) you can go ahead and send
them in and attack. If not, wait for a group attack.

 Once you do attack, another ghoul will show up to help. Focus on taking out
the mages first (especially the conjurer), or if you are running out of time
on the bombs just stop it asap. Wipe up the enemies and this fight will be
over.

 Well, we saved our teammates and our kiev. Time to head back.


 o Objective: Return to the Kreuzbasar


 The Kreuzbasar
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You emerge from the foulness of the sewers only to be met with the
    equally dark stench of cordite and death. Although you've saved the
    kiez, it is far from unharmed. Residents wander the streets dazed,
    holding their wounds, tending to others, observing the damage. The look
    in their eyes tells the story - their illusion of safety has been
    shattered.

    You enter Paul Amsel's trade emporium already knowing what you'll find
    there. The knowledge doesn't make the discovery any easier.


 You will get a karma reward here for saving the kiev, as well as an
objective for what to do next:


 (KARMA GAINED: 8)

 o Objective: Read Alice's Optical Chip on the Mission Computer


 Go ahead and head back to the hideout and go through the grieving process
that awaits you. It's sad... my first time playing this game I TOTALLY expected
Paul to not be completely with us... but he truly was on our side the whole
time and paid the ultimate price...

 Once you're done, check out the mission computer and start off with the
Shadowland BBS. Claim your payment for the paydata here: [_540 NUYEN_].
After that go ahead and check out the Optical Disk.

 This is obviously where we finally get some answers... sort of. The good
news is that Alice HAS found Vauclair, and he is alive, being held captive
at Harfeld Manor. Are you KIDDING me? Grr...

 The bad news is "rescuing him will not be possible". Not only is the place
likely physically guarded by a small army since we stumbled upon it, but it
is also guarded by an AI named APEX, who has been killing deckers and
hunting out anyone threatening Harfeld Manor and the Firewing. That... well,
that explains Monika and Green Winters.

 Our ONLY lead for now, short of a suicide run, is APEX. Thankfully, Alice
has found a backdoor access point to Apex and sent us the coordinates. This
gives us an objective after talking with the team about our plans:


 o Objective: Head to APEX's Backdoor Facility

 (-NOTE-) Your teammates should have leveled up to LEVEL 5 at this point, so
          be sure to increase their stats and abilities when you get a chance!


 BEFORE we go out to take care of APEX though, you have now unlocked your
teams LEVEL 6 abilities, so be sure to level them up. You have also now
unlocked the last tier of equipment in the shops, so THE BEST EQUIPMENT IS NOW
AVAILABLE TO YOU. Get out there and spend that massive amount of money you've
saved up!


 (-NOTE-) As before, we're about to run down the inventory of the local shops
          down below. Be warned: there are a LOT of shop blocks here. Just
          scroll past them all if you don't want to buy anything.

          This is the final set of equipment, so spend your money as you wish
          and get the best stuff you can afford.


 (-NOTE-) We are only covering NEW ITEMS in these boxes down below...

 Next up is the TRIAGE Clinic to the northwest, which honestly doesn't have
that much new in it. Note that I am not counting the "Adrenal Contractor" as
new down below, as I pointed it out earlier.

 That is that!

 Nothing else to do now except head to APEX and see what we can do with it
thanks to Alice's information. Head to the U-Bahn and select:


 "Assemble the team, and travel to the coordinates that Alice provided to
  find a backdoor access point and shut down the APEX AI."


 Time to take on the APEX predator of the matrix...

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ APEX. An artificial intelligence designed for Matrix warfare. The thought
    of it sends a chill down your spine.

    For years, the shadows have been ripe with rumors of true AI. Names like
    "Mirage" and "Psychotrope" have fueled conspiracy boards on the Shadowland
    BBS since 2029. Most savvy shadowrunners dismiss these stories as bunk.

    But from what Alice has told you, at least one of these stories is real.
    APEX is waiting for you, somewhere down in the basement of an abandoned
    Saeder-Krupp lab.

    Unfortunately, you're going to have to wade through a lot of gang
    territory to get there...



 As the chapter starts, we're out on the street with our team and we'll be
given an objective:


 o Objective: Find a way into the Basement to Access APEX's Kill Switch


 Head forward and you'll see a gang right away. Great. You'll be stopped by
the big ork here. Try to tell him you want to go to the basement and you'll
get an [INTELLIGENCE: 2] option to detect his sarcasm (oh really!?). Still,
his gang has been kicked out of the building it sounds like, by a gang called
the "Magnifikers", so you can get past him easily by offering your services.
Do so and he'll offer you "200 Nuyen per kill". If you have [CHARISMA: 5], you
can bump that up to 250 Nuyen per kill. Do it if you can. Lastly, ask about
how you can get into the basement and you'll get an objective to kill the
enemy gang's leader:


 o Objective: Kill Trithemius


 So... it sounds like the only way to get into the basement is the elevator,
and that is missing the Power Coupler and the Control Chip. Fun. If you have
the [ETIQUETTE: GANG] option, you can demand a better reward than just access
to the basement.


 NOTE: I didn't personally k now what this "Better Reward" was, but thanks
       to my request for help a reader, Jack, emailed me this information
       which I'm posting below (and it really does make sense...):

       "Ulrich promises you a weapon you'll find in their armory in the
       basement, and when you bring him Trithemius' amulet, he gives you a
       key. I believe it's the same key that Ulrich drops if you kill him,
       because it doesn't open anything that you didn't already mention in
       the guide. Ulrich seems to have two copies of the key though, because
       if you kill him after he gives you the key, you'll find a key on his
       corpse as well.

       So if you decide to kill off mages gang, this means you can skip
       killing the Arbeiters gang and still get all rewards.

 (END NOTE)


 So, money for shooting up gang members isn't a bad option, so let's take
the deal and head inside the building to continue. Either entrance will do.


 In here, the "HUB" is to the left. Talk to the operator, Parson, to learn
what it is they do. Sounds like escapism to me, but hey, what do you think
you are doing right now? You can ask him about getting to the basement and
he will offer his help if you get a part for him. Agree to do so for another

 o Objective: Recover Parson's Terminal Part


 To the right down here is probably the only upstanding person in this
place, Karl the shop-owner. Well, he does stock drugs, but at least he is
working. You can buy some stuff from him if you want:

 Head down the hallway now. You can check out the elevator here if you wish
and use [DECKING: 3] to confirm the elevator is busted. Good to know. Head to
the stairs now (examine the rubble if you wish) and choose to go to the 2nd
floor first.



 APEX Building: 2nd Floor
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Head forward down the hallway and admire the nice anarchy sign. This door
right after the sign will lead into a fight once you open it, but before you
do so, position your forces so Eiger has a clear shot into the room when the
fight starts:


  Fight: Mage Battle!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Here we'll be battling against FOUR mages. One is a conjurer and another
is a "healer". Haven't seen many of those, but that is our first target! If
you set up Eiger into a good position, she can snipe immediately and take the
healer out ASAP.

 Other than that, have Dietrich buff up Glory with Haste AND Aim, then have
Glory adrenaline herself to create your melee monster. Send her into the back
row to just ruin the mage's day. Take out the healer first if they aren't
dead, otherwise focus on the conjurer to take them out quickly. From there it
is merely taking out an enemy at a time until the fight is dead.

 Be sure to grab their amulets once they are all dead.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the battle, head into the northern room and interact with the spell
book on the pedestal for [_POWERBOLT III_], and then the one on the shelf
for the spell [_GLUE_]. Really only useful for mages


 Head forward down the hallway and hit up the next door. This room looks
abandoned. Check the drawers in front of you for [_21 NUYEN_] and head to
the back room straight ahead. There's some HUB graffiti back here, but the
drawers also have some [_BLISS_] in them. Head to the right part of the room
now and enjoy the art. The back part of this half of the room has a note in
the back that says "Shark Tank". Good to know? It is indeed!


 Next up head down the south hallway and you'll see two more rooms. Open the
doors up and head in the lower one. Up ahead you'll see some tenants of the
building (who AREN'T crazy "hub" kooks) who will tell you they've been ran
out of their apartment by the rogue spirits. Here you can offer to help them
out if you wish. This nets you an optional objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Clear the Spirits out of the Third Floor Apartments


 Note that you CAN ask for a reward here if you wish, and you'll even get
[_500 NUYEN_] up-front. You can even lie here and tell them you took care of
the problem, but there's some karma on the line here so just accept the extra
work and continue on.

 You can also get info about the hackers (Janet) from this group, who promises
to give you their password if you help them out. Another good reason to help
them, I suppose.


 Lastly, across from the stairs on this floor is a computer console we can
interact with. This is the home of Janet's Pad, and contains the parts that
Parsons wanted. You can access it now IF you have either [DECKING: 6],
[CHARISMA: 6] or you found the "Shark Tank" note up above (that is their
password).

 We could deal with them right now, but let's head up to the 3rd floor for
now and clear it out for the apartment dwellers. We'll come back to Janet
for sure though, don't worry, helping Parsons is essentially REQUIRED to get
to the basement anyways. Onto the 3rd floor!



 APEX Building: 3rd Floor
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 We'll have quite a few fights on this floor, so make sure your people are
ready. This includes the first door we open, which will put us right into a
battle. Be sure you get Eiger in a clear shooting view as you open the door:


  Fight: Battle of the Spirits
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight is you against five spirits, the spirits who ran the group of
metahumans out that you talked to downstairs. Time to earn our paycheck, I
suppose (or rather, let's earn that karma!).

 Thankfully, the five spirits in this apartment are rather split up, so at
the start we're only facing two enemies. Note that these things are called
"Magnifiker Free Spirit", showing that the new ganger group really did call
these things into being and let them go rampant. They look like Apocalypse
type enemies though. Go ahead and take them out one at a time and then split
your group up so that some members (Glory) go north while the other members
(Eiger/Dietrich) go south as you head to the right side.

 The right side of the apartment has the last three spirits in it. Note that
one has what looks like a gun attached to it (which is odd), but this one is
slightly beefier than the others (more HP). If you're looking to thin numbers
quickly, take out the bigger spirits first but they all have horrible accuracy
so it isn't too big of a deal. Take them out one by one and we'll be done.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once the battle is over with, check the northern dresser to find a [_PREMIUM
MEDKIT_]. Consider it your "tip" for clearing out the demons. Head back to the
hallway now and continue on. This next door is ANOTHER battle, so get ready.
No need to line Eiger up this time, but we'll definitely use her shooting
skills here:


  Fight: Cleaning out the Magnifikers
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This will be another mage battle, so squishy targets will be ventilated.
We are fighting five mages in total, but the first mage is RIGHT near the
door so taking him out will be very easy. Don't buff up quite yet and take
him out. He does warn his allies around the corner, so they will all be in
cover waiting for you.

 Rounding the corner will put us against the main force, which consists of
two mages, a healer, and a conjurer. Have your team round the corner as a
team instead of just one person charging in. Ideally you can put Eiger in
the back and buff her up, as her sniper rifle can make short work of the
healer or conjurer (go for the healer first, then the conjurer). You could
also buff up Glory first and let her run in, giving Eiger Aim on the next
turn since she's close but either way Glory should run in and break up the
party.

 Note that the enemy mages in the far back often group together behind cover,
meaning you can hit three of them easily with AoE abilities if you wish. I
never took advantage of this in this fight as Glory had already ran up there
and started tearing into them, but if Dietrich can get an AoE shot off or
you want to test Eiger's grenade arm then go for it.

 Also, note the spirit shrine in the back here. I actually never got around
to using this, so I'm not sure what it contains but my gut says "Apocalypse".
These mages are so squishy and between Glory and Eiger I took them out too
fast to test the summon point.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the battle (and collecting the amulets), head to the back and interact
with the middle object for a [_FORCE 5 NATURE ELEMENTAL FETISH_]. Next, check
the bookcase for the [_SHADOW_] spell.


 Head back to the hallway and take the southern path now. Interact with the
first intercom here and ask the paranoid man if a spirit would be using the
intercom or not. Before responding, read the note below for some dialog
options. Tell him you've killed the spirits and he'll unlock the door. You
can tell him that you've taken care of the spirits and he'll run off to join
the hub at this point. Meh... we can explore his place to find some [_CRAM_]
though.


 NOTE: Here's another tip from Jack (who helped out up above!):

       Actually you get a bit funnier dialog if you tell him you are a
       spirit: "Boo!", followed by telling him you're about to eat his soul.
       This way he'll let you in as well (with Eiger commenting she can't
       believe that worked). There's also an item you missed in the guide:
       if you say "Hello?" in the next dialog you get an option to use Street
       etiquette and get a Jazz stim from him, before he runs away.


 The next apartment to the south is empty... for now. We'll be back her later,
so make a note of this place and head back to the 2nd floor.


 APEX Building: 2nd Floor
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Head back to the group of metahumans to report your success in clearing out
the spirits. They will thank you and head back to their apartment, giving you
the password to reach Janet, "Shark Tank". Not that we need it. More
importantly we get a good chunk of karma:


(KARMA GAINED: 3)


 OK, time to go deal with Janet and get Parson's part back. Head to her door
and give them the password (or again, you can use the [DECKING: 6] or
[CHARISMA: 6] options if you want) and you'll get inside the room.

 Talk to Janet here and you'll learn the part is literally the ONLY thing
connecting them to the matrix. We aren't given a whole lot of dialog options
here, as the game sort-of pushes us to GETTING this part back no matter what,
but if you have [INTELLIGENCE: 3], you can ask to see her set-up to see if
there isn't another way around this. If you don't have that (or one of the
options down below), you are forced to fight here:


 777 (SELF NOTE): Need to add in optional/forced fight here.


 Go check out the terminal to the southwest and you'll see the jury-rigged
computer she has set up. If you have [INTELLIGENCE: 5] here you can deduce
a solution (which results in the objective down below), or if you have
[DECKING: 8] (which is a HIGH requirement), you can just outright fix the
issue right here. Here's your potential objective:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Find an Impulse Transmitter


 If you are going for the optional objective, you'll need to go see Karl at
the shop downstairs. Head down there but BEFORE YOU TALK TO HIM note the
painting behind him. It is a portrait of Janet. Hmmm...

 Go ahead and talk to him and tell him what you want. He'll want a hefty 1,000
Nuyen for the part. Ugh. If you have [CHARISMA: 4] or the [ETIQUETTE: STREET]
option you can lower the price BUT... you shouldn't do EITHER of those options.
Instead, just mention Janet and you will "convince" him (with threats) to give
you the [_DATAJACK IMPULSE TRANSMITTER_] for free.

 Head back up to Janet's room and replace the part, netting you the [_SIGNAL
CONVERTER_]. Head back down and return this to Parson for information on the
Magnifiker leader. Parson will tell you that the leader is holed up on the
third floor, in the last room in the hallway. Look for the "M" on the wall at
the apartment at the end of the hall. Head up to the third floor now.



 APEX Building: 3rd Floor
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Head to the last apartment on the floor, down the hallway to the south.
The very last apartment. Once inside you can interact with the bookcase to
open up a hidden room (a HUGE room). This is where you'll find the Magnifiker
leader, Trithemius.

 Go ahead and save, then head in and talk to Trithemius, who comes off as way
in over his head. He will offer to buy you off, offering you a fetish and the
power coupler for your troubles.


 Honestly, when it comes down to it, you can choose to either side with the
Magnifiker's or the Arbeiter's. It makes no difference, but SOMEONE has to
die. Personally, I say we take them both out. Do the place a favor and collect
the loot that each gang is protecting, but if you prefer one over the other
for whatever reason, just make a deal with the side you like. This guide will
be killing both sides though.


 With that said... tell Trithemius to shove his offer and get ready to fight!


  Fight: I put on my wizard hat!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Another fight against mages, but this one has the leader thrown in to boot!
This fight has a mage, a healer, a conjurer and of course Trithemius. Being
the leader, Trithemius has the most HP but doesn't hit much harder than his
comrades so I would leave him for last. He CAN summon things however, which
undoubtedly makes him a bigger annoyance but I would still take out the
healer followed by the conjurer first. After that, focus on who you wish.
Remember: once you kill the summoner, the conjured monster dies!

 Dietrich can turn Glory into a monster on turn one (Haste + Aim), which he
should do and have Glory try to stun the healer or conjurer while the other
team members try to either kill them off (if they don't stun) or take out
the remaining target. After that, Dietrich can cast aim for Eiger and heal
as needed as you wipe out the mages one by one. All in all, not a hard fight
at all.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 NOTE: If you happened to tell Trithemius that you planned to kill Ulrich,
       you will get the top objective below. If you fight him, you'll get
       the second objective below once the battle is over with:


 o Objective: Kill Ulrich

 o Objective: Find Trithemius's Power Coupling


 We have plenty of goodies to gather up after killing off Trithemius though.
Gather up the amulets around the room and check Trithemius's corpse to find
[_TRITHEMIUS'S AMULET_] and [_TRITHEMIUS'S KEY_].

 Next up is looting the three rooms to the north. Enter the far left one and
check the desk for the [_ELEVATOR POWER COUPLING_], which completes our
objective, then loot the room for a  [_FLAMETHROWER III_] spell book and a
chest for a [_FORCE 4 EARTH ELEMENTAL FETISH_].

 Head to the middle door now and loot the heck out of the place to find an
[_ADVANCED MEDKIT_], [_220 NUYEN_] and some [_CRAM_]. Lastly, hit up the
door on the far right for the [_ACID STREAM 2_] spell book and the desk for
[_87 NUYEN_]. Not bad.


 With one gang down, head to the bottom floor and out the front exit. Before
the bloodshed, go ahead and sell your amulets to the ork (may as well...) for
a whopping [_2,400 NUYEN_]. Very nice. Now, like I mentioned above you can
either side with Ulrich here or take him out. You can check the items below
to see what you can get, but I just choose to take them out here as they seem
little better than gangers to me...


  Fight: The End of Communism...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is a bit of a tougher fight than the one against the mages. Ulrich
has four other allies on his team: two enforcers, one "heavy" and one physical
adept. No real "squishy" characters here really, so our plan should be to tie
up who we can (using AP draining moves) and then focusing down one enemy at a
time to tip the odds in our favor. Having Eiger mark them or having someone
use tracer can help a ton if you do them before killing your target.

 As usual, you can (and likely should) turn Glory into a beast with Dietrich
with haste and aim, then aim Eiger the next round and either heal or use an
AoE attack if you can. Glory should try to AP drain someone (I was able to
AP drain the heavy on the first round... very nice!) and then focus on your
mark. Eiger is likely right in the mix, so use her shotgun or rifle as you
see fit.

 Ulrich is a tougher foe with 100 HP, so I ended up focusing on him last as
I killed off his gang one by one. Do the same and keep up the heals to take
out this communistic gang.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Once the gang is dead you can pick up the [_GANGER'S KEY_] that Ulrich will
drop. We'll use this key later on. You also have access to the three item
chests the gang was guarding. The top chest has a [_GANGER MASK_], which is
a piece of unique armor. This thing grants +1 quickness and +5 HP, but is
likely not worth it unless you aren't buying armor or something....

 Check the bottom chest for a [_PREMIUM MEDKIT_] and finally check the middle
crate for the [_ELEVATOR CONTROL CHIP_]. This last crate gives us an objective
which you probably didn't need:


 o Objective: Fix the Elevator


 Well... we are done dealing with the gang members at last it seems. They all
lay dead! MUWAHAHAHA! Head inside now and fix the elevator (which is just you
examining it) and continue on down to the basement...


 APEX Building: Basement
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The elevator rumbles and clanks its way downward, into the guts of the
    old Saeder-Krupp development lab. Eighteen years ago, this place - and
    the project that was being developed here - disappeared from the record
    books. Thanks to Alice, you are one of the few people alive today who
    understand why.

    Alice was clear about one thing: you are here because APEX wants you to
    be. If the AI hadn't wanted her to trace it here, she'd have wound up as
    dead as Monika. For better or worse, you're here at APEX's invitation.

    The elevator grinds to a halt. The doors slide open, and your nostrils
    are assaulted by eighteen years' worth of stale air. APEX - and the kill
    switch that will deactivate it - await.


 We get a new objective upon entering the basement:


 o Objective: Find the AI Terminal


 Head to the room on the upper left from where you start to find the ARMORY!
There is a LOT of items here for you. Loot the place to find an [_ARES HIGH
EXPLOSIVE GRENADE_], a [_M79 GRENADE LAUNCHER_], a [_PREMIUM MEDKIT_], and a
[_BUMONA GOLD TRAUMA KIT_].

 All that leaves is the safe. You can bypass the lock here with [DECKING: 7]
if you want, or if you killed (or helped) Ulrich, you can use the "Ulrich Key"
item. Either way, you can loot the safe here for the [_REMINGTON ROOMSWEEPER_]
pistol, which has a "shotgun punch and spread in a heavy-pistol-sized package."
Not bad! Take it and head back to the hallway.


 Enter the lower room here (the only way we can go) and you will find a note
on the table, the [_APEX SHUTDOWN AND PURGE NOTES_]. Go ahead and read them
to learn HOW to kill APEX. Interesting.

 Now, on this next part I recommend you go down the LEFT side and open up all
the doors. This will help with Eiger shooting enemies later on. As you head
down you are forced into a central room, where you will meet...


 Monika!?!? No... APEX.


 NOTE: This is a BIG choice in the game and how the endings turn out. Namely:
       do you ALLY with APEX like it wants or do you KILL OFF the AI that
       killed your friend?

       No one choice is "good or bad" here really, and this choice is totally
       up to you. On my first run, I chose to kill off the AI, but you get
       STEAM Achievements for almost every choice in the game. I've allied
       and killed APEX, so I'll point out the differences below, but just note
       that the guide was written for KILLING the AI, so the optional notes
       below are for if you side with APEX.


  Fight: Killing the Killer AI / Helping the Killer AI
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Did you choose to kill off the AI that took Monika from us? Excellent!
Picking this option gives us a ton of objectives to focus on:


 o Objective: Destroy APEX

 o Objective: Defend the Main Control Terminal

 o Objective: Activate Both the Emergency AI Purge Controls


 === OPTIONAL: HELPING THE AI ===


 o Objective: Hack Both the AI Control Nodes

 o Objective: Free APEX


 This battle is going to be LONG and BRUTAL. Notice that once the fight does
start, you have a bar for the "AI Interface Terminal Health" and bars for the
"Purge Control 1/2 Inactive". These notices illustrate our goals for us: we
need to activate the two purge controls (at the bottom of the rooms, one on
each side).


 NOTE: If you HELP the AI, note that you have to "Hack Control Node 1/2".
       This is all done in the MATRIX section of the fight, which means it
       is a lot bigger than if you try to kill the AI. Weirdly. This actual
       battle doesn't change a whole lot... you just don't got to worry about
       the purge controls.


 The FIRST thing you should do is send your decker to the right, to jack-in
to the turret terminal over there and activate that side of turrets. We can
only activate ONE side of turrets at a time, and the right turrets are the
best for now. See the matrix section below if you wish.


 OK, now for the real world battle. It should be noted that you have to
manually wait for the control to complete once the purge has been activated,
so this battle is mainly about defending the two rooms outside of the AI
Terminal until you can activate the purge.

 The first wave of enemies is three hub junkies: the humans that are part
of the "Hub Communion". It seems they are brainwashed to defend APEX. They
are easy to kill though. They are joined by Heavy Security Drones, which have
quite a bit of HP and high defense. The first round of enemies is three humans
and a machine on the left side.

 With our decker setting up the right turrets, have Dietrich buff up Eiger and
send her left to try and snipe the enemies up north. Glory should go left as
well. After Dietrich buffs up Eiger and Glory, send him down to interact with
the "Purge Control 1" to the south.

 Also, note the Spirit Shrine in the left room and the upper left room. Both
of these spirit shrines contain "Wind Dancer" enemies. Don't use them yet, but
save them for later when even more enemies come in. They have fantastic attacks
including electricity AoE attacks that can help quite a bit.

 Glory can rush the enemies if you wish, but I'd wait for them to come south
(EVERY enemy group comes south eventually) so Glory and Eiger can pick them
apart. Once Dietrich hits the purge he should either head north to buff up
the enemies some more or you could have him run to the other purge control if
your decker is still busy (doubtful) or if you want your decker to be in the
fight.

 From there it is ALL about protecting the two rooms outside of the main AI
terminal room. With the turrets on the right side you can often just use your
main character to defend the room (for me it is two drones and two turrets),
and on the left you have Eiger, Dietrich and Glory. Not a bad set-up. You can
send Glory over to the right if you want, she can cover the distance easily
with haste and/or adrenaline boost and of course Dietrich has the summon
spirits on the left side.

 After the first wave of enemies comes round two. Note that the junkies will
carry stun guns now which can be a REAL pain. I would focus on killing those
junkies first. This round gives you FIVE junkies on the left side and one
security drone, and the right side is four junkies and a security drone.
Let them come down and take them out one by one, focusing on the stun-gun
junkies and humans first. By now your hacker should DEFINITELY be done with
getting the turrets up and you should have the purge controls either being
activated or done.

 From here on in it is just fighting and defending. You'll likely face two
more rounds of enemies at least. Round three has SIX junkies and two security
drones on the right side and a mere three junkies on the left side. Definitely
send Glory over for this round and let them come into the turret room to make
things super easy.

 The fourth round of enemies should be the last. Enemies just POUR in at this
point. On the left side is FIVE junkies and two security drones while the
right side has SIX junkies and two security drones. Our last battle more or
less for this chapter. Wait for them to come down. If you're going to use a
spirit summon, go ahead and do it here. Near the end of this round you will
get an objective:


 o Objective: Input Final Delete Command


 OR.. if you are freeing the AI:

 o Objective: Reconnect the Hardline


 When you see this, the purge charge is done and you can head to the central
computer and use it to delete the killer AI. Whatever enemies are in the room
at this time will DIE, so go ahead and do it ASAP. Note that enemies KEEP ON
COMING if you don't go hit the terminal, which does mean a "Round Five" of
enemies if you choose to face them. No point in doing so, so hit that AI
terminal and take out APEX.

 NOTE: Hit the main terminal when you see the "Reconnect the Hardline"
       option above. When you free the AI, the enemies here will be freed
       of their mind control, instead of dead if you killed the AI.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Here's the Net Instructions for the fight up above as well:


 o NET INFILTRATION: APEX Turret Controls
 |
 |
 |  For a fight against an AI, we really don't do a lot of Matrix running
 | in this battle as a whole. If you took my suggestion and went into the
 | right turret jack-in spot first, you will arrive straight into a battle.
 |
 |  This far-right screen is still tough. You face up against three white IC,
 | a black IC, and a white sparky. Five vs. One. Ugh. Hopefully you have your
 | Decker upgraded with version 3.0 weapon abilities. This is likely too hard
 | otherwise. Get into cover right away on the right side and start taking
 | out the IC right away (white first - take down the number of enemies that
 | are shooting at you). Once their turn comes and goes, use Blaster if you
 | can hit more than two things with it and always get in an Erosion and
 | Killer shot when you can. Heal whenever you need to (and you'll need to).
 | Once you have killed the enemies off, turn on the EAST Turrets and jack-out.
 |
 |  It SHOULD be noted that you don't "have to" jack-out here. You can go
 | to the left and fight even MORE enemies in the central room if you wish,
 | although it is HIGHLY ADVISED NOT TO. There is absolutely no reason to do
 | this, but of course I had to explore... this center room have a whopping
 | FOUR Black IC and a white sparky. Tough foes to be sure, but you can kill
 | them all if you wanted. This room leads to a jack-out point to the south
 | and a pathway to the left.
 |
 |  The left path leads to the western turrets, but of course these are
 | guarded as well. This side is actually a little harder than the other side
 | as you face two white IC, two black IC, and a sparky. You can kill them off
 | and activate these turrets, but again, you can only have ONE SIDE OF TURRETS
 | ON AT A TIME.
 |
 |  It should also be noted: EVERY time you head to another room, the enemies
 | RESPAWN. It really sucks, but you can ignore them if you wish. You should
 | only be turning on the turrets and jacking-out though, so this is more of
 | an FYI than anything.
 |
 |
 |   === OPTIONAL: Hack Control Nodes ===
 |
 |  Hacking the Control Nodes is very similar to the above section. The
 | only differences is there is much more fighting in this Matrix section.
 | However, we gain another decker in this section as well: Monika! Well...
 | Her AI at least. Follow the instructions above and turn on the east turrets
 | like normal, but from there head south a screen. You'll see "Control Node
 | 2" down here and you'll have to kill off two Black IC, three White IC, and
 | a White Sparky.
 |
 |  The Monika AI is powerful, but probably not quite as good as your Decker
 | of course. Still, having her with you will speed things along, just be sure
 | you keep her healed (you can heal her and vice versa). Take out the enemies
 | listed above and hack "Control Node 2".
 |
 |  From there, we have to head all the way to the West Turret room. Do so
 | but DON'T FIGHT along the way (it is faster this way). Once you get to the
 | West Turret room, head SOUTH (Don't fight!) to the next "Control Room Node",
 | where you'll find "Control Node 1". You'll have to fight the same set of
 | enemies as up above, two Black IC, three White IC, and a White Sparky.
 | Kill them off and hack "Control Node 1", and our job will be done here.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 So, once you destroy the AI (or no matter WHAT you do, really), before it
goes, it will drop a HUGE bomb on you as a "parting gift". For some reason.
It will post a live video feed of Harfeld Manor.

 The Dragonslayer... is not a captive... he RUNS Harfeld Manor. HOLY SHIT...


 Is the feed real though? Who knows. How does this relate to the Firewing?
So many questions but no answers.


 NOTE: For taking out APEX, you will get the "Won't Suffer an AI to Live"
       STEAM Trophy/Achievement. Very nice!

 NOTE: For freeing APEX, you will get the "It Seems Trustworthy" STEAM
       Achievement. "Seems" being the operative word here.


 With no answers left at THIS location, go ahead and leave to head back to
the kiev and get ready for Harfeld Manor...


 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your trip back to the Kreuzbasar is a restless one. Now that APEX has
    been dealt with, the window of opportunity that you've been waiting for
    has opened. The Harfeld Manor is vulnerable.

    The video fee that the AI showed you circles over and over in your head.
    Vauclair, and Audran, and the strange woman in the containment device.
    The revelation that Vauclair runs the Harfeld estate. And his assertion
    that... *something*... was set to happen tonight.

    The train glides to a stop. You push through the doors and onto the
    platform. There's no time to waste.


 Like most runs, you sill get a karma reward and objective here:

 (KARMA GAINED: 12)

 o Objective: Meet with the Team


 BEFORE going to talk to the team you can go around and talk to the community
for some interesting dialog. Namely, talk to Samuel by the U-Bahn station (or
to the right) to learn of Silke's fate if you helped her earlier in the game.
A bit sad. You can talk to Simmy up to the north as well, then go talk to the
doctor to be able to question him and tell that he is lying. Why though? Very
odd... Lastly be sure to go talk to Absinthe in the magic shop and ask her
what she is. This is VERY interesting and almost makes you wish they did a
story around her at some point.


 Go talk to your team now and you'll discuss what you last saw and what needs
to be done next. We have to assault Harfeld Manor. Again. That is where all
of our answers lie, and with APEX neutralized we actually stand a chance.

 NOTE: If you allied with APEX, you will get a new runner on the team, a
       giant drone. You can bring it with you on the next run if you wish,
       although it takes the place of a runner. Really not worth it. You
       DO get some unique dialog options if you do, but nothing special,
       trust me.


 After the talk, you'll get your objective:


 o Objective: Use the Tunnel Beneath the Hideout to Reach the Harfeld Manor


 It should go without saying, but BE SURE you are stocked with healing supplies
and buy the best items you can. No reason to save money or karma at this point
so be sure you are ready and have saved, then go to the van and proceed to
start some of our final chapters of the game and head back to Harfeld Manor...

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The van lurches forward. The smell of anxious sweat hangs close and
    thick inside, making the cramped vehicle feel even smaller. The streets
    of Berlin are strangely quiet as you make your way past the city limits.
    It's as if the whole of the Flux State is waiting for something. A calm
    before the storm.

    An hour later, the van rounds a corner. In the distance you can see the
    silhouette of Harfeld Manor, backed by the light of the full moon. You
    switch the van's headlights off and shift to electric. A short while
    later, you kill the ignition and roll quietly down the last hill, pulling
    to a stop on the side of the road. A bird of prey takes wing from a tree
    above you, beginning its nocturnal pursuit.

    You know how it feels.


 After a short pep talk, we will begin our run of Harfeld Manor. This whole
thing should be... interesting. Our objectives:


 o Objective: Find Vauclair

 o Objective: Get to the Freight Elevator


 We are focusing on that Freight Elevator for now. Head forward, interact
with the gate and enter. You'll get into a fight iwth a SINGLE HELLOUND here
that you can kill off easily enough. No battle box for him. Just one enemy.
Take him out and head to the left (note the gate up to the north), where we
will get into a fight past the wall area.


  Fight: Where the Hellhounds Sleep...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight can go a couple of ways. We want to make it go the easy way.
For this reason go ahead and buff up Eiger with Dietrich. Haste and Aim, like
normal. Send Glory north to attack and see the layout of the area. You'll see
a bunch of cages with Hellhounds in them and a control panel for them off to
the right. Now, put Eiger in range of that control panel and kill off whoever
is trying to open up the cages. That is Eiger's job in this battle: lock that
control panel DOWN.

 Everyone else needs to get up there and kill of the other two human guards
in the area. Not too hard, but once they are down this battle will be over.
Needless to say, if you can't lock that control panel down, you will have
three hellhounds added to the fight and we don't need that.

 Also, be sure to grab the [_ESTATE COURTYARD KEY_] that one of the guards
drops upon death.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 With that battle down, check out the immediate area to the south of the
cages to find two lockers to interact with for a [_PREMIUM MEDKIT_] and a
[_DEFIANCE SUPER SHOCK_]. Both to the stash for me. Head back to the area on
the right and open up the gate to get into another short fight.


  Fight: Beyond the Gate
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight is hardly worth mentioning. Two guards are running to the north
as soon as we get through the gate. Here you should just buff up Eiger with
haste and aim and use her sniper rifle to take them both out. Note that you
can close the gate with the control panel here, but it is unneeded.

 Even if you kill off both guards, the battle doesn't end. There's a good
reason for this though: as you move forward the two gargoyle statues will
come to life!


 NOTE: In the upcoming fights, if you can walk AROUND the gargoyles, you
       can avoid fighting them. Which can be a bit hard to do, but if you
       can do it less fighting for you!


 These things have high defense and about 80 HP. Additionally, once they die
they will explode into some sort of acid mist that hurts whoever is caught in
it or whoever passes through it. For this reason, runners like Glory should
move away whenever they are close to death (assuming you use her to shred
people to ribbons... aka, the "right way"). Keep your distance and shoot them
to pieces to end this fight.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Head north now and you'll see another gate. The "Gate Controls" to the north
do not work however, as Eiger states they "locked the front door". Makes sense
I suppose. This means we have to head to the left, where we will get into a
fight.


  Fight: Guarding the Elevator
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is a bit of a two-part fight. The first part is very simple, but the
second half is... rough. The first part is pretty easy though: you will see
two guards running around to the left. Eiger can likely snipe them from
wherever you start, which may kill one of them at least. As you head up to
deal with them, note the two gargoyles to the left and right. They will burst
to life when you get close, so take them out one at a time (easier that way)
to finish the first half of this battle.

 You will note that the battle DOES NOT END once you kill these four enemies.
There are mort to the north, beyond the walled sections. For now, just bring
up all your allies past the first wall and park them there, out of the way of
the enemies. Once you've done that, send someone up to see what you are up
against, then pull them back down.

 As you'll see, there are a TON of guards up to the northwest. About seven or
so (counting is hard!) including a Grenadier, a Drone Operator and a Mage.
Mostly guards though. There's also three gargoyle enemies up here, two up
close to the start (to the left and right) and one in the far back that won't
bother us until later.

 By sending someone up to look at the enemies and sending them back to safety
the enemies will start by coming down to us. This means they'll bunch up, right
where the entrance to the courtyard area is near us. It is... a thing of beauty
to be honest: Dietrich can cast some AoE on the group, Eiger can hit multiple
people with grenades or her Shotgun (up to you) and even Glory can hit multiple
targets with her blades. In fact, even enemies may help here if they target us
with shotgun blasts (which is fantastic).

 So. after the kill zone that is the courtyard entrance, split up and flank
the remaining enemies, trying to destroy the gargoyles from range (I would
leave human enemies to Glory if you can so she doesn't eat damage for no
reason). You can also summon a Typhoon Spirit here with Dietrich if you wish.
He is a big help in wiping up the rest of the enemies, with good buffing and
debuffing skills and some hard hitting single skills. Wipe out all the enemies
here and head northwest to trigger the last gargoyle. After you defeat the
final gargoyle, this battle will be over.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Use the elevator to the northwest when you are done to unlock it and then
use it to continue. We're going to head down into the lab, in search of
answers from our Dragonslayer...


 The Lab Below
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ After making your way across the manor grounds, you wind the servants'
    entrance open and the immediate interior clear of any resistance.

    You find the elevator that you used during your prior escape waiting
    patiently for your arrival. It shudders to life now, ready to carry you
    down into the facility below. To the place where Monkika met APEX and
    the world turned upside down.

    Where this whole thing began.


 Head forward and you'll see two guards in the lab area that we lost Monkika
in. These guards don't quite merit an attack box in my opinion, but we do
need to take them out. You can buff up Glory to get her behind them for the
flank bonus (or your drones, if you're a rigger like me). Take them out and
they will drop the [_LAB KEY CARD_].


 NOTE: If you let APEX free, these guards will both be DEAD. One less fight
       you have to do. Pretty nice. ALSO, the turrets in this area will be
       on your side, so in all those battles if there are turrets nearby you
       can count on their help... somewhat.


 To the south is a jack-in point that you can interact with for a comment
on Monika. Eiger will get to see where she died at least. Next up, inspect
the terminal to the north. There are logs here of the research that has been
going on, although they are ALL hard to understand. The first entry has
options to skim it or understand it if you have [BIOTECH: 5] or [BIOTECH: 7]
respectively. The second entry can be read with [BIOTECH: 6]. The third entry
here can be skimmed or read if you have [SPELLCASTING: 5] or [SPELLCASTING: 7]
like the first entry, and finally if you have [INTELLIGENCE: 7] you can make a
guess for what "Panacea" is.

 For those who aren't able to guess it, I'll try to summarize Panacea. It is
basically a plan to create a magically-backed bioweapon, that can target
certain genetics and be distributed through the air, as well as be controlled
on when it activates. Hopefully that is a good summary (as I wrote this part
after reading / moving on from the terminal). It is obviously related to what
the lab here was built for. You can tell there's some SERIOUS research going
on at this facility.

 Also, being able to guess at what "Panacea" is will grant you a BIG Karma
Bonus:

(KARMA GAINED: 5)


 Head to the north now and open the door. You'll see the turrets are offline
here since APEX is down. Very good. Continue to the north and we'll get into
a fight:


  Fight: Pushing Onward...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 As you enter the door you'll see three guards taking cover. Three guards
is apparently by cut-off for a battle box. Heh. The guards will take cover
right away, all spread out with varying health.

 Buff up Glory and send her to the right to get behind them and help take
them out (going to the right to get rid of their cover bonus is a good idea
anyways, as even Eiger does low damage with them in this good cover). Spread
out your forces and take these guards out one at a time.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 Moving on we have a few rooms to choose from, but go RIGHT first to the
area with the locked safe. This is the security room and has a locked safe
and terminal, but a jack-in point we can use. Sweet!


 NOTE: If you allied with APEX earlier, this maxtrix run is not needed.
       The safe will automatically be open.


 o NET INFILTRATION: Harfeld Manor Security Room
 |
 |
 |  This matrix area is honestly pretty short, being only two rooms. Head
 | right to the second room and you'll end up in a battle right away.
 |
 |  We will be in a fight with several spread-out enemies here. In total,
 | there are five white IC, a white sparky, and a black IC. Stay near the
 | starting area and let the first set of enemies come to you, which will be
 | three white IC and the sparky. Take them out and head southeast now, taking
 | on the two remaining IC to the north and south and the black IC by the node
 | when you get down there. After taking them out you, we can finally hack the
 | "Lab Security Network Access" node. Nothing to do now but head back and
 | jack-out.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 After hacking the node you can use the nearby security terminal. Go ahead and
unlock the "Drone Remote Control Box" and "Lab Security Cameras". Note that
with [DRONE CONTROL: 5] you can "Enable Drone Remote Control Box for direct-rig"
if you wish (all this does is let you expressly control the drones, instead of
the AI). Unlocking the control box lets you open up the save nearby, which will
give you the [_DRONE CONTROL BOX_] directly to your inventory. We can use this
handy little thing before battles to put drones in three upcoming rooms, but I
will note it all down below.


 NOTE: To USE the drones, you have to interact with the controls in the lower
       right corner. I'll point out below where you can use them at.


 Next up, head back to the previous room and enter the northwest door (the one
you can't see behind). Interact with the terminal here. With [DECKING: 5] or
with a decker on your team (which is RARE that the game actually takes THAT
into account), you can hack an account on the terminal. Go ahead and read all
of the emails for the [_STORE ROOM ACCESS CODE_], which is 1247. Fun. Good
time to use a medkit if you are fully stocked, by the way (see below).

 This lets you head back to security room and access the door north of the
room. Interact with the control panel on the right, use the code to be let
inside. Here you can find a [_PREMIUM MEDKIT_] and a [_BUMONA GOLD TRAUMA
KIT_]. I ended up putting both of these in my stash, but that's just me.


 Nothing left to do now except enter a fight in the room to the left. You can
do this by either entering through the left doors or that door to the south.
I would do the lower left door, for access to that long counter for a good
defense point.


 NOTE: You CAN use the drones in this room for the fight down below, but it
       IS NOT recommended whatsoever. A later fight could use these drones a
       LOT more and another room coming up could use them for goodies, so DO
       NOT use them here.


  Fight: Fight in the Lab
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 There are more enemies in here than you'd think! Five guards in total,
including a mage and a grenadier! Spread out as you enter the room due to
the threat of grenades and buff up Glory with Dietrich to have her go up and
take out the mage as soon as you gain. Your main character and Eiger can than
focus on the Grenadier.

 Once those two foes are taken down you are left with just regular guards
and can burn them down one at a time. Not too hard. Just watch out for their
grenades and stay spread out, killing them off one at a time to end this
battle.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 You can read the terminal here next for some inter-network emails that are
rather interesting. Seems like some researchers have had their own problems
with the things they are researching on. You just KNOW we're going to find
out for ourselves, right!?


 Head north now and you'll see an armory to the right. This armory has
a cracked wall and no other way to enter it. It is of course only going to
be opened up by the drones. Or rather, the self-destruct of the drones.
I would ONLY use them here if you REALLY NEED the items down below... which
I will list in the next paragraph. If you dont' need these items, I HIGHLY
RECOMMEND you use them in the fight below instead.


 OK, so if you "Deploy Drones to Weapon Storage" you can park them near the
wall on the left-hand side to blow them up and open up the weapon storage
(just skip through the fighting rounds). Doing this gives you access to all
sorts of goodies, including: a [_FIREBALL II_] spell, the [_RUGER SUPER
WARHAWK_], the [_RENRAKU FLASHBANG GRENADE_], TWO [_HE PHOSPHORUS GRENADE_]
items, and the [_SCK MODEL 100 [SMARTLINK]_]. Again, like mentioned up above
a few times, you can ALSO use these drones in the fight below, so if you do
not need these items (which you really shouldn't), you can use them down
below.


 OK next up is the fight in the General Storage room. If you can, go up to
the lower door here (the nearby one, so Eiger can shoot into the room easily
when the fight starts) and use the drone control if you still have them. If
not, well... no big deal. Some minor damage and targets lost, but you can get
through this.


 Oh, and also, once you deploy the drones, whether it be the armory or the
general storage area, you get a karma reward:


(KARMA GAINED: 2)


 OK, let's get this fight started:


  Fight: General Storage Showdown
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 There is a WHOPPING NINE enemies in this fight. Just... crazy, and part of
the reason extra drones would be helpful here (if you can get them... if not
they don't make THAT big of a difference). The enemies are spread out a ton
in this room, with three mages spread out amongst them.

 From the front door I start out buffing up Glory and then having Glory
give herself Adrenaline as well. I then have her go up the right side to
the first mage and start attacking. She will be a beast for a few turns this
way, killing off that mage easily by round two so just have her carry on from
there, terrorizing the back of the enemy lines and picking off whoever she
can. Eiger can sniper from where you start, but Dietrich should put Aim on
her when he and then take cover (I actually had him use his Dragonslayer Icon
here to mitigate damage for Eiger while she stood in-place and fired away).
Hopefully your main character is a bad-ass, because his (or her) offensive
capabilities will be tested here.

 If at all possible, try to take out the mages first as they can heal and
shield their allies. If Glory is in range, take out mages with her. Eiger
should just be shooting up whoever is not in cover. Out in the open she can
take out an enemy per round if you get a good crit, otherwise try to mop up
with Dietrich or your main character. Reducing the enemy number is very, very
important her to limit the damage we are taking.

 All in all this is a good skill check of a battle. If you can get through
this with minimal loss, you are in pretty darn good shape. Don't be afraid
to use a medkit though.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 With the battle done, go ahead and interact with the door to the north to
move onto the next area. We are coming up to the end of the game at this point,
I promise. Let's press on.


 Panacea
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ The sounds of machinery fade behind you as you venture further
    underground. Whoever built this facility was clearly well financed.
    It must have taken years to design, excavate, and build a complex like
    this in secrecy.

    You continue through dimly lit halls, finally stepping into what appears
    to be another laboratory area. The corridor before you is deserted.

    Dr. Adrian Vauclair is somewhere within this facility... and with him,
    the answers you seek.



 ( - IMPORTANT NOTE - )

  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU SAVE HERE. The ending you get is highly
 dependant on how your talk with Vauclair goes when you find him, and that
 is coming up! Best to have a save file handy!

 ( - END IMPORTANT NOTE - )



 So you are saved up? Good! Head forwards now and you'll be in a hallway.
Follow it to get into a large room where you'll see.... Dr. Vauclair!

 This is one of the turning points of the game. There are exactly three ways
this talk can turn out, and it is entirely dependant on how your talk goes
and what you know. Option 2 leads to a STEAM achievement, so aim for that
one if you can. We'll go over all three options below.


 OPTION 1: TALK WITH VAUCLAIR - CONTINUE NORMALLY

  This is the "normal" option and isn't by any means bad. Listen to Dr.
 Vauclair's plans and confront him with what he is done. As long as you DON'T
 OFFER to join him and don't get him to break down, this is the path you will
 walk (again, perfectly fine).


 OPTION 2: TALK WITH VAUCLAIR - BREAK HIM DOWN

  This option is the "dialog works" option. Rather rough to get from my
 experience, but unique. How do you talk the famous dragonkiller down? By
 bringing up his brother. That is the start of his breakdown. During this
 option you have to question him constantly, but DO NOT offer to help him
 until you see the "If Herbie were here, he'd stop you" option.

  That means bringing up the fact that mistakes cost lives, recalling the
 lab accidents. Call the Berlin plan mass murder and hit the [ETIQUETTE:
 ACADEMIC] option if you can. Keep discussing the virus from there for an
 [INTELLIGENCE: 6] option about the virus mutating. Talking about the virus
 gives you a [BIOTECH: 5] option and after that an [ETIQUETTE: ACADEMIC]
 option (talking about if the virus is "peer reviewed").

  You can also bring up the fact that there are "worse things out there"
 if you talked to Absinthe earlier, as well as bringing up the power vacuum
 that might be left. Overall, bring up his brother WHENEVER you can and if
 all done correctly, you'll get the "what would Herbie do" options, which
 lead to the "If Herbie were here, he'd stop you".

  This will make Dr. Vauclair break down. Offer to help him from here and
 he'll call everything off. Enjoy the rest as you wish.


 NOTE: You will get the "Change of Plans" STEAM Achievement if you pull this
       off. Very impressive!


 OPTION 3: SIDE WITH DR. VAUCLAIR

  This option... sure is different. In it you can pick to actually AGREE with
 Dr. Vauclair once you know what he is trying to do. This results in you
 FIGHTING with your team. This is highly dependant on WHO you have running
 with you. But I know for a fact that EIGER, DIETRICH and GLORY will fight you
 if you side with Dr. Vauclair.

  This turns into a battle that is, as you can imagine, ROUGH. You will have
 to fight and kill your teammates, whoever you got running with you. I was
 able to do this by myself as a RIGGER by using a turn to get to cover to the
 south in the hallway, then sending by drone in to burn them one at a time.
 Dietrich first, then whoever is easiest next. This can go REALLY well if you
 get Dietrich to summon some spirits in and they turn on the team.

  After that, you just wait for Vauclair to do what he is going to do. This
 whole thing is covered under the "One Year Later (Alternate Ending)" section,
 after this section. Check it out if you pick this option, although very, very
 honestly you don't need a "guide" for that at all.


 No matter WHAT you do, we'll get into a fight:


  Fight: Taking down the "experiments"...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This battle is against the "experiment fodder" that Vauclair and Audran
have been keeping, which you'll see are Fire Drakes. These things aren't too
hard actually, but have 120 HP which is quite a bit. Only moderate defense
though. Like the gargoyle things though, Fire Drakes will explode in a burst
of flames once you kill them. Yikes!

 We start out with just one though, so buff Eiger up and send her north a
bit and have her snipe it over and over. It should be NEARLY DEAD by the time
she is done with four turns. After that, you can wipe it out with whoever,
but be sure to send Glory to the right to get her in a good position.

 On the next turn, a second Fire Drake will show up from the right (from the
other cage over here). Put aim up on Glory and let her get some hits in, then
shoot the thing to death. Also, you should be able to send someone to the
north to get that [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] on the column here. Safety first, right?
If you have any turns left over, send your people to the left (see the cages
over there?) to get them in a position to take on the next enemy.

 The third Fire Drake will show up soon enough from the upper left. If you
are in position you can get into firing on the beast right away. If not, get
everyone into position to defend the lower walkway here (Eiger with her
shotgun is good as a line of defense). The next turn will bring on a fourth
and final Fire Drake. Burn down the wounded one and then focus on the fourth
one to bring an end to this battle.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the battle, you can talk to the Firewing to proceed. This isn't much
of a talk - the years of isolation and being out of its body have taken its
toll on the great wyrm - but it does beg for help. You can either agree to
help it, lie, or be vague about helping here. The choice is up to you as the
dragon points out a way out no matter what, and the ACTUAL choice of helping
the dragon isn't here.

 No matter what you do, the dragon points out the floor grate you can use
to escape, giving you an objective:


 o Objective: Descend to the Levels Below


 Well... no point waiting around here. Take the grate and let's continue!


 Into The Dark
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You squeeze through the narrow gap beneath the floor panels and climb
    down into a large space beneath the lab complex. Darkness surrounds you,
    and the air smells moldy and stale.

    As your eyes slowly adjust to the light, you can make out the dim planes
    of cobweb-covered walls and scattered construction equipment. Judging by
    the dust and disrepair, this place appears to have been abandoned long
    ago.

    Meanwhile, somewhere else beneath the Harfeld Manor, Dr. Adrian Vauclair
    is preparing to wake a dragon and unleash it on an unsuspecting Berlin.


 Here we are beneath the lab. So dark... we got to get back up there quickly
which is our current objective:


 o Objective: Find a Way Back Into the Facility


 There are papers behind you but it is too dark to read them. Head forward
and pick up the [_REGULAR GASOLINE_], then head up north. Up there you will
have to kill a scorpion enemy (one enemy, just have Eiger shotgun it to death)
and then pick up the [_DIESEL FUEL_] you find.

 Head back to the south now and interact with both generators. Go ahead and
fill them both up and start them both. This should turn on the lights. Let
there be light! This also means you can read the papers to the right. Sounds
ominous? Yeah.

 Use the door controls to the left now and open the door. You can look through
the cracks in the floor here if you wish. Open up the next door now and check
out the PDA you find. It mentions the scorpions and drakes hate each other.
Good to know.

 Well, we can't enter door to the north, so go left instead. To the north are
some more planks you can look through. Do so to see another guard team waiting
for us. Lovely. Notice all the blasting charges all around them... hmmm, it
would be a SHAME if something bad happened to them...

 The north path leads to two scorpion enemies. As you know, two isn't enough
for a battle box, so take them out. Eiger can nearly kill one on her own
with the shotgun and cleaning up the second shouldn't be hard. There's yet
another crack here that shows a room with fire drakes, but more importantly
there is a STAGE TRANSITION TO THE LEFT. We'll use this in a bit, so remember
where it is!


 Head north to another crack (not much here) and go left now. The far left of
this area in fact, to the "Mysterious Rock" area. We are going to get into a
battle  over here, but you want to approach from the north (right of the rock)
to make things significantly easier:


  Fight: Fight by the Mysterious Rock
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This fight is barely worth a battle box, but here we are. If you took my
advice up above and came in from the right of the rock, chances are good
that when you start this battle, two of the scorpions on the right will come
over to fight while a third one moves to the LEFT (away from us). This of
course makes the fight much easier and you can burn one down per turn very
easy.

 If not, oh well. You can get in some AoE attacks with Dietrich if they
group up while coming at you, otherwise burn them down one at a time and chase
that third scorpion down to finish the fight.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 This "Myterious Rock" is something that you can examine after the fight. Do
so to get a [SPIRIT SUMMONING: 5] option to "probe the stone with shamanic
power" or a [SPELLCASTING/CONJURING] options to "use astral perception to peer
at the rock". Do the spellcasting/conjuring one first. Amazingly, you can
actually let a TEAM MEMBER do this as well. Letting Dietrich probe the stone
will result in you gaining a [_FORCE 4 EARTH ELEMENTAL FETISH_] as well as a
[_FORCE 6 EARTH ELEMENTAL FETISH_]. Not bad!


 Head to the lower right area now, south of the blasting zone area (head to
the ominous-looking corner). Down here you'll fight two Fire Drakes. They
are spread out a bit so you can burn one down at a time easily enough. Kill
them off (approach from either direction) and you will find an [_RFID CARD_]
down here. Sweet.

 If you remember, this is the card blocking the door from the start of the
area. Head back to the start of the area now and use that ID card on the
upper door console. Use the terminal here, arm the explosives, and finally
detonate the explosives. Hehehe...


 Go check out the hole you made. Beautiful. Go ahead and transition to the
lower level now, using the vent to your north.


 This area is a bit bigger I believe and definitely has more rooms. At the
start, pick up the [_VENTILATION MAP DIAGRAM_]. This will be handy earlier
but note you can look at it ("look") in the mission items.


 NOTE: If you freed APEX earlier, it will stop you here and ask you to help
       it take over the Firewing Project. You can either chose to help it
       or tell it to shove off. As you can imagine, this changes the ending
       you get appropriately. This is not a HARD CHOICE though, so you can
       say anything right here.


 From here, head north to a jack-in spot. Time for a matrix section:



 o NET INFILTRATION: Under Harfeld Lab
 |
 |
 |  A fairly short matrix area, but VERY helpful in the end. Head north
 | and you'll see we are in a "hub" area of sorts. Let's do this in some
 | sort of order...
 |
 |  Start out by going left and killing the two white IC you find. Take them
 | out (nothing to you by now I'm sure) and read the "Security Logs" you find
 | here. This ends up giving you the [_SUPPLY BOX CODE_], which is 3971. That
 | will help later.
 |
 |  Head back and to the north now, taking out the enemies you find here and
 | hacking the "Secure Door Control". Open it up and head back to the hub.
 | Finally head to the east room, which has two white IC and a sparky. Again,
 | nothing, so take them off and open the "Secondary Door" node. This will be
 | very handy later. That's all we have to do, so go ahead and jack-out after
 | you're done.
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 We can go to a LOT of places from here, but let's go through this area
systematically. Head to the north room (which is empty) and get ready for a
fight. Enter the right room to start it:


  Fight: Scorpion vs. Fire Drake
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 This is a multi-room fight that doesn't exactly feature your team. The top
room has two scorpions in it, but the room right below you has two Fire
Drakes. If you let them, they will move towards each other and fight each
other (a previous note mentioned this, by the way).

 That is rather slow though... it's better just to kill whatever crosses your
path if you ask me. Blast the nearby Scorpion, letting the second either go
to the Drakes or fight you. Take it out and move onto the Drakes to the south
next. They are rather spread out, so you can focus on one at a time and take
them down. Just remember they explode in flame when they die!


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the fight you can search the northern room for a WHOPPING TOTAL OF
FIVE [_RUSSIAN MILITARY GRENADE_]. I really don't think you need them, so
they'll likely go into the stash.

 Head to the room you jacked-in at now and go left. This room is empty, so
head south and you'll fight another battle.


  Fight: Scorpion! GET OVER HERE!
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Hardly worth a battle box, but there's three of them I suppose. The shelves
in the room space the scorpions out a bit, so burst them down one at a time.
Eiger's shotgun tears these things up as usual and Glory can get in with no
worries. Take them all down and we'll get an awesome item...


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


 After the fight, check out the shelves and pick up the two items you can
interact with for some [_NERVE GAS_] and an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_]. The nerve
gas in particular is handy for skipping a fight earlier (although we don't
NEED it...). It's good to have options though.

 Head two rooms to the south now and you'll see a workout room. This room
actually has two Fire Drakes in in. Go in and kill them off, burning them
down one at a time. Once they are dead you can check the corner of the room
to gain TWO [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_].


 From here, head north to a door on the right. You will see the caved-in room
we made earlier. This would ORDINARILY be a fight, but we bypass it because
of our... explosive personality (*groan). Continue south and head right to
find an HVAC unit.

 This HVAC lets us bypass another fight... what you want to do here is to
hit BUTTON NUMBER 4, then use the manual bypass option, then use the NERVE
GAS you found earlier. Hehehe...


 Go back to the hallway and head north. Here you'll see a "Secondary Door"
which you can use to bypass the fight in the room to the right if you unlocked
it during the matrix room up above (way #1 to bypass this fight), OR you can
just ENTER the room to see the result of your nerve gas attack... you evil
runner, you (way #2 to bypass this fight).

 Either way, after you get past the fight room you can find an equipment
crate. This crate was mentioned earlier and the code is 3971 (which we know
from the matrix run above). Once you open it, you'll get FOUR [_KAMIKAZE_].
Not bad. Go ahead and use the room transition to continue onwards. We are
nearing the end, runners!


 You will find yourself in a medical room now. Here you can use the medical
station to fully heal up. There are also medical supplies here, which you can
pas out to give EVERYONE ON THE TEAM a [_PREMIUM MEDKIT_]. WOW. We are very
obviously at the end now, aren't we?!?! To the right of that are also two
boxes EACH with a [_BUMONA GOLD TRAUMA KIT_]. Really being set up. Go ahead
and use the lab blast door to continue on to the final area of the game:


 Dragonfall
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You exit the clean-room to find yourself at the threshold of a vast
    underground chamber. If the abandoned facility that you just fought
    through was purgatory, then you now stand at the gateway to hell. The
    heat emanating from ahead hits you like a hammer - the smell of sulphur
    and ozone is enough to make your lunch want to find somewhere to hide.

    Above the noise created by the whir of turbines, you can hear the deep
    rumble of something feral waking up. Something very, very big.

    You check your weapons and step into the vast chamber.


 Here we are, the final fight. You'll get a talk from Dr. Vauclair here if
you got "OPTION 1" up above, which includes an [ETIQUETTE: ACADEMIC] option
that gives some unique dialog. No matter what though, even with "OPTION 2"
up above, we get into a fight here:


  Fight: The Unknown Battle for Berlin...
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 Here we are, the final battle of the game. First, our objective:


 o Objective: Stop the Virus Infusion Process Before It Completes


 The first thing you should note here is the "Feuerschwinge Virus Level"
gauge in the upper level. This thing goes up by turns and, when full, the
Firewing will be thoroughly infected and the battle lost. I mean, I assume.
I haven't lost this fight ever... and neither will you!

 We can actually LOWER this level as well. There are actually two ways to
do this fight: the MATRIX route or the riskier KILL THEM ALL route. I'll go
over the matrix route but if you want to roll the dice and trust your
killing skills don't bother with the matrix section below.

 Anyways, go ahead and deck in to the "Matrix Pump Access" with your decker.
Buff up Eiger now and send her halfway up to the decker so she has aim over
the area she came from as well as the main room. Glory can buff herself up
with Adrenaline and go attack whoever is closest. Note that the upper left of
the room has an [_ADVANCED MEDKIT_] on the pillar, not that you will need it
since everyone got some before this fight.


 The start of this fight will have a Mage to the left and a Grenadier and
another Guard to the north. Have Eiger take out the mage and Glory go attack
the guards. By the time turn three comes around, there will be another guard
up north and a mage and a mercenary to the south (which is why we wanted to
have Eiger still have sights on the south). There will also be two "Bodyguards"
show up somewhere: they have stealth on when they appear and very likely may
have gotten an attack in before they showed up. They use melee attacks and may
do AP damage.

 Keep up the killing and soon Audran will show up to fight, along with two
mages from the north. The mages need to be taken out first, as they will
often shield and heal people, but after you take them out you can focus your
attacks on Audran, which actually gives us an objective:


 o Objective: Defeat Audran


 IF YOU ARE SKIPPING THE MAXTRIX SECTION, YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON TAKING OUT
AUDRAN! Killing other enemies makes him come out faster, which helps, but
once he does show up, take out those two mages ASAP and focus on Audran. Use
Glory's ARMOR destruction abilities to soften him up, have your Decker mark
him, and then have Eiger tear him up.

 Once he dies, he will drop the [_EMERGENCY STOP KEY_], which you can use
on the terminal to the left to stop the virus transfusion process.

 OTHERWISE, once your Decker turns on the VENTING SYSTEMS, you can have a
party member turn on each pump and then turn on each vent to the north. This
takes some turns to do of course, but more importantly, WHOEVER turns the
vent is TAKEN OUT OF THE BATTLE. But once you got both vents going AT THE
SAME TIME, the virus transfusion will also be stopped.


 Past that, all you need to do is take out Audran and whoever is left alive
at the end. Leave Audran until ALL the mages are dead and then take him out
by shredding his armor. After that the battle is as good as yours.


 ~ BATTLE END _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯



 o NET INFILTRATION: Matrix Pump Access
 |
 |
 |  Final Matrix area of the game. A short one at that. Head north once you
 | can (this first room just exists to eat up two moves, I am convinced) and
 | you'll be in a room with the two pump access nodes. In this room you need
 | to kill off the White IC, Black IC and Sparky to the left as well as the
 | White IC and Sparky to the right. The right sparky in particular is a
 | shielding one, but take out whoever you can quickly, then wipe up whoever
 | is left. Hack the "Aux Virus Venting System A" to the left and the "Aux
 | Virus Venting System B" once they are all dead and you'll be set up for
 | the fight above. Now jack-out and help with the fight!
 |
 |
 `-.---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


 After the fight, we'll have one more thing to address:


 o Objective: Confront Vauclair


 Vauclair will have one last bit of dialog to tell you, but in the end, he
will take matters into his own hands. Well... what a twist. Very sad. We will
get some objectives here:


 o Objective: Exit the Facility

 o Objective (OPTIONAL): Free Feuerschwinge


 IF you freed APEX earlier in the game, you get a third objective here:


 o Objective (OPTIONAL):  Transfer Control of Feuerschwinge to APEX


 The choice is yours of course. This very much affects the outcome of the
game of course, but is totally your choice. Do you free the Firewing? Do you
kill her? Do you give control to APEX? You don't have to make this choice
without knowledge though...


 NOTE: Be sure to SAVE here so you can get the extra STEAM achievements if
       you want them at all. This is an excellent place to save, BEFORE you
       make any choices!


 First of all, head to the command console and send Firewing down to the
chamber you are in. You may as well open the doors to leave while you are
here.

 Now, from here you can talk to Firewing if you wish. It takes a little work,
but you can ask her why she did it ("couldn't find the green").  She also
mentions all sorts of ancient things, but refuses to explain them. Ask about
her forever tasks to get the dialog options: [SPELLCASTING/CONJURING],
[INTELLIGENCE: 3], and [ETIQUETTE: ACADEMIC] options. These will explain some
things to you but also lets you understand where her purpose was.


 From here, you must make your choice. You can either kill Firewing manually,
you can just leave her and set the facility to explode, or you can set her
free, telling her of Amazonia. The choice is up to you. Make it and leave.



 THE KREUZBASAR
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 MID-STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ You step out of the van, climbing down into the tunnel leading back to
    your safehouse.

    Just hours ago, you saved Berlin from fire and ash, from the would-be
    sacrifice of Dr. Adrian Vauclair. It feels strange now, returning in
    secret. In Silence. The other residents of the Kreuzbasar go about
    their business, unaware of what almost happened here tonight.

    It's finally over. Your team, and your kiez, are safe once again.


.Back home. We get an objective here:


 o Objective: Meet with the Team


 NOTE: You seem to only get ONE acievement at a time down below... or at the
       very least I did. Just so you know! No idea why they'd do that...


 NOTE: You will get the "Clean Slate" Steam Acievement here if you chose to
       destroy the facility.


 NOTE: You will get the "Needs to Cool Off" Steam Achievement if you chose
       to just leave Firewing in her containment cell in the previous
       section.


 NOTE: You will get the "Never Make a Deal With a Dragon" Steam Achievement
       if you chose to kill off the Firewing in the previous section.


 NOTE: You will get the "Fly Free, Great Wyrm" Steam Achievement if you chose
       to free the Firewing in the previous section.


 NOTE: You will get the "Apex Ascendant" Steam Achievement if you chose to
       hand over control to APEX in the previous segment.


 Go talk with the team and pick what you will. Glory in particular will
bring up her side mission and you can TRY to join her, but if you insist too
far you will just piss her off. Best to let her (and the spirit) do what they
need to do. We get an objective here as well:


 o Objective: Meet with Altug


 Go around and talk with the neighborhood at this point. You can't talk to
everyone, but talk to the troll to the north, Simmy to the far north (she's
really made a change), and of course Absinthe and Aljernon to the south who
are outside their shop.

 Once you are done, talk to Altug who will offer to be your fixes. No matter
WHAT you do though, you'll agree to go see his contact. Even if you don't
want to...


 o Objective: Take the U-Bahn to Brandenburger Tor


 Head to the U-Bahn and enter. You will end up talking to a strange man on
the train (or a very familiar-looking man if you played Shadowrun Returns).
This fight can go a few different ways, but is mainly for role-playing
purposes. You'll learn who you were "working for" the entire time. You may
also be offered a job if you pick the right choices (mainly the pro-dragon
choices), working for the "Great Dragon Lofwyr".


 So... is this your stop? Perhaps in the next age...?

 Either way, you'll step into the shadows once again...

 ENDING SUMMARIES
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Here are some examples of the ending summaries you can get. As you can
 see, these paragraphs are highly dependant on your choices but are for the
 most part just a single choice away from changing. This list isn't all
 inclusive at all, but covers the more important changes:


 o Save Firewing, Explode the Estate, APEX Dead:
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Berlin NewsFax contains just one report of a large-scale explosion in the
  countryside east of Berlin. An abandoned castle is reportedly consumed in
  a massive fireball that shakes the countryside and leaves a crater 60 feet
  deep. A natural gas leak is suspected, and the location is soon cordoned
  off by unidentified corporate forces. This news is eclipsed when Saeder-Krupp
  announces its acquisition of Arianespace, the last remaining arm of the
  European space program.

  The Flux State's anarchist rule remains until 2055 when joint corporate
  forces, acting with the support of the German government, invade the city.
  Its widely known that the Great Dragon Lofywr is responsible for orchestrating
  this action. After weeks of fighting, the surviving anarchists are forced to
  retreat to the eastern part of the city. A truce is signed in 2060 and Berlin
  is again divided by a wall.

  The Great Dragon Dunkelzahn is elected President of the United Canadian and
  American States in 2057. He is promptly assassinated as he leaves an
  inauguration party at the Watergate Hotel while in human form. Popular
  opinion is that another great dragon is responsible, as "only a dragon can
  kill a dragon"... but those in the shadows hint that an act of powerful
  blood magic is the cause.

  Grainy photographs of a large winged creature crossing a full moon above
  the Harz Mountains circulate in Germany for several years. Conspiriacy
  theorists take this as evidence that a new Great Dragon has emerged... but
  when no further sightings are reported, interest wanes.

  The name of Dr. Adrian Vauclair has since been lost to the shadows...



 o Kill Firewing, Don't Explode the Estate, APEX Dead:
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Berlin NewsFax contains just one report of a shootout in an abandoned
  holdfast in the countryside east of Berlin. The identity of the combatants
  remains unknown, though several rival political factions are suspected, and
  the location is soon cordoned off by unidentified corporate forces. This
  news is eclipsed when Saeder-Krupp announces its acquisition of Arianespace,
  the last remaining arm of the European space program.

 o Side with Vauclair, Kill your Team, Kill the Dragons:
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 By the year 2065, metahumanity has been reduced to an endangered species.

 Huddling in sewers, subway tunnels and underground bunkers, desperate
 clusters of survivors fight with one another over dwindling supplies of food
 and water. They have long since learned to carry out their conflicts in
 silence; noise can attract the predators that now dominate the Earth's
 surface. To draw attention of a Horror is to invite a hideous death.

 On the surface, the Horrors congregate in rolling swarms. They slither,
 scuttle, and crawl over the bones of metahuman civilization, hunting in
 packs and eviscerating anything with a heartbeat.

 The largest of these monstrosities hang impossibly in the sky above the
 ruins of the world's great cities, casting shadows that stretch miles across.
 These godlike leviathans gorge themselves on the residual misery of the long
 dead. Slowly but surely, they pick the carcass of mankind's reign clean.

 Hope is a thing of the past. Metahumanity has reached its end.

 But the scourge that has replaced it has just begun.

  Berlin NewsFax contains just one report of a shootout in an abandoned
  holdfast in the countryside, east of Berlin. In a matter of hours, the
  report vanishes without a trace, as do several prominent deckers who
  attempt to dig deeper into the event.

  The Flux State's anarchist rule remains until 2055 when joint corporate
  forces, acting with the support of the German government, invade the city.
  Its widely known that the Great Dragon Lofywr is responsible for orchestrating
  this action; the Golden Wyrm is said to be surprised by the speed and ferocity
  with which the F-State assembles to repel the attack. In 2060, rumors surface
  of Lofwyr meeting with an unknown representative of the Flux State.
  Hostilities abruptly cease - a truce is signed the same year, and Berlin is
  again divided by a wall.

  The Great Dragon Dunkelzahn is elected President of the United Canadian and
  American States in 2057. He is promptly assassinated as he leaves an
  inauguration party at the Watergate Hotel while in human form. Popular
  opinion is that another great dragon is responsible, as "only a dragon can
  kill a dragon"... but those in the shadows hint that an act of powerful
  blood magic is the cause.

  Rumors of an exchange between a "godlike" artificial intelligence and the
  feathered serpent Mujaji, ruler of Azania, first begin to surface in 2061.
  A decker named Tolstoi claims that this is a new stage in ongoing negotiations
  between the AI and dragonkind, but this claim cannot be confirmed.

  The name of Dr. Adrian Vauclair has since been lost to the shadows...

 STORY SYNOPSIS:

  ~ Your old van rattles over the uneven terrain as you make your way bck
    to the Harfeld Manor. Vauclair's message to you was as short as it was
    cryptic: "URGENT! Come back to the lab. Your assistance is needed."

    In the year since Vauclair released his Panacea, the world has gone
    throught a lot of changes. The balance of power has shifted from one
    megacorp to another; market shares have risen and fallen. A worldwide
    effort to find a cure for the "Wyrm Flu" continues.

    The dragons are dead.

    Vauclair's work was a rousing success. But over the past few months,
    strange things have been happening. Unexplained magical phenomena. The
    emergence of strange new creatures. Disasters, both natural and man-made.

    You van rolls to a halt. If anyone can explain what's happening to the
    world, Vauclair can. It's time to go find him.



 So... you decided to rebel huh? Well, you will get an additional chapter
as a reward. Or more of a wrap-up. You will find yourself back in Vauclair's
lab a year later. We aren't told what we were doing, but we are given an
objective:


 o Objective: Speak to Vauclair


 Read the terminal here, which catches you up on what happened to the dragons
once Vauclair's work was done. Amazing, really. He really did it. Once you are
done, the doors will unlock. Head to the right and talk to Vauclair.

 Go ahead and agree to help (we may as well at this point). Vauclair will want
you to read up on the terminals in the lab next. There is one to the north you
can read and two to the south. Read them all to see what is happening on a
global scale (things are CRAZY!). Go back and talk to Vauclair afterwards.

 You'll try to think of a way to solve the problems that are happening. After
going through a few dialog choices, you'll have an [INTELLIGENCE: 5] option. It
seems we have no way out of these magical phenomenon. It seems like... the only
thing that was holding back these things was... Dragons...

 Upon realizing the truth, Vauclair will take the easy way out, giving us an
objective:


 o Objective: Speak to Audran


 You'll find Audran to the north. Go talk to him and share a drink if you
wish. You'll learn of his motivations here, but it doesn't matter. In the end
there's nothing we can do. Chose to either end things yourself or chose to
fight as this alternate chapter comes to a close.


 NOTE: By picking this option, you will get the "Unintended Consequences"
       STEAM Achievement. Well... that's the best way to put it, for sure.

 Here you can find a list of all the items, gear, weapons, outfits, spells
and other assorted categories of items in Shadowrun: Dragonfall. This list is
split up into TYPES of items and lists where to find the items and often
their armor/damage ratings and text descriptions. Why add all this in?
Because Bkstunt is apparently crazy... that isn't exactly new news, is it?

 Shadowrun: Dragonfall comes with a total of 39 Achievements found in the
Steam Achievement list. I've documented them all here and given tips on how
to obtain them all. I'm much more of a Trophy guy for PSN / PS games, but
I'll settle for Steam Achievements I suppose!

 Most of these are surprisingly easy to get, so if you tried you should have
no problem getting 100% Achievements for this game! I haven't personally got
100% (again... I'm more of a PS Trophy guy), but I'll list them all her
anyways!


(-NOTE-) This list is NOT necessarily in the same order as it is originally
         on the Steam Achievement page... but order doesn't seem to be very
         important as there aren't very many "story" achievements here...
         This order is actually from the Steam Achievement list on GameFAQs
         itself.


         Also note that this list is FULL OF SPOILERS!!!! DO NOT READ IT IF
         YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME!!! This is mainly due to the four ending
         achievements in the middle, but still: I am REALLY good about pointing
         out easy achievements throughout the guide (I think!), so you won't
         be missing much if you leave this until the end of the game and check
         it out then!

  How to Obtain | This is an achievement you can get if you use Eiger
                | naturally, as she has the option to go full-auto once you
                | get her her rifle weapon. If not, you can get it by giving
                | your character a rifle and upping their skill in it until
                | they unlock that option, then using it to kill enemies.

  How to Obtain | You can get this naturally with a spellcasting main

                | where you can give him advice. Do so and keep talking to
                | him whenever you can and you'll eventually get his personal
                | mission "Settling Debts". Do that and continue talking to
                | him to get his achievement.

————————————————|——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
  How to Obtain | This is a funny achievement that you'll probably get without
                | even trying. Still, if you know about it ahead of time, you
                | can try to get it by purposely trying to hit enemies with
                | a low % to hit. Once you get that lucky shot off, this
                | achievement will be yours.

————————————————|——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
  How to Obtain | This is a story-related achievement that you'll probably
                | get naturally for killing the Humanis leader in the mission
                | "False Flag".
                |
                | Note that this achievement is in direct conflict with the
                | "Everybody Deserves a Second Chance" achievement, so you
                | will need to reload to get both of them.

————————————————|——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
  How to Obtain | If you know about this achievement, you can get it rather
                | easily by using Eiger and her sniper rifle on someone at
                | point blank range. Up the accuracy with skills when you do
                | this as your accuracy will naturally dip a ton, but you can
                | kill one enemy and get this rather easily. Maybe even on
                | accident.

                | This is a very cool achievement that shows what happens if
                | you happen to agree with Dr. Vauclair. This means killing
                | off you team and then following the alternate ending until
                | you reach the end of it to see what happens. Easy to do if
                | you save in the right place.

  How to Obtain | The easiest way to do this is to put Glory's BLEED effect
                | on an enemy, and leave him alone once he gets to 4 or less
                | HP. He will naturally bleed out in two turns or less, which
                | will pop this trophy. You may get this naturally as well.

  How to Obtain | This is a story-related achievement that you'll get if
                | you chose to destroy APEX during the mission "APEX Rising".
                | This is the one that I think most people chose, to be

                | given the chance. Note that it is in direct conflict with
                | the "It Seems Trustworthy" achievement, so you'll need to

 Version 1.00: December 29th, 2015 - June 3rd, 2016
 --------------------------------------------------

 Yikes, this took a LONG time eh? Sheesh, what have I been doing in the
meantime? Um... hmm, well Fire Emblem Fates FAQ/WALKTHROUGH and Fallout 4
DLC. Other than that, I'm just working much more slowly nowadays it seems.
That's what happens when you have a full-time job and a family I suppose!

 Glad to be finishing this up though. I absolutely loved Dragonfall and the
Director's Cut was the perfect excuse to not only go through it again but to
make this guide. It helps having already done Shadowrun: Hong Knog as well.

 Anyways, I hope that you all enjoyed this guide and may we meet again in
the future!


 Version 1.10: January 10th, 2017
 --------------------------------

 Added in 5-6 reader tips I had sitting in my inbox for... well, months.
It definitely took long enough for me to update, huh guys!? Well, these
tips knocked out a few self note / requests for help throughout the guide
at least, making it that much better.
