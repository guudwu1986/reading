This is mostly a sequential walkthrough, which means that it will go in
the order that I think is a good one (not necessarily the best way to do
things, but one that worked well for me).  Since a lot of elements in
Baldur's Gate can be done at any time, this presents a few problems.  So
currently I have all the Major Plot points listed as Main Sections, with the
smaller areas as Sub-Sections.  This works, but I'm not sure that it is the
best way to go about this.

i. Introduction                                                      [IINTRD]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Strange things are happening in the Sword Coast.  The iron has gone bad,
  every weapon forged with it is completely worthless.  Bandits plague the
  Coast stealing everything else that already isn't ruined.  And people are
  muttering that it is all the work of an outside interest bent on domination.
  Some say that it is the Zhentarim, some say that it is the Amnish, although
  they have troubles of their own.

  Amidst all of this you have grown up in seclusion in the Candlekeep fortress,
  a keep of knowledge.  You have never known your parents, instead you were
  raised by the Sage Gorion.  You might have remained in this sheltered life
  forever, had not fate played its hand.  Because of the growing threat of evil
  in the world, Gorion feels compelled to remove you from Candlekeep, and take
  you to another hiding place where he will "explain everything".

  And so it began...

  Baldur's Gate is the latest in a long string of games set in the Forgotten
  Realms.  The game uses (for the most part) the AD&D rules to set the
  gameplay.  It also endeavors to create the sense that you are on an AD&D
  quest yourself, and not just playing the game, but rather are in the game.


  I orignally omitted information that I felt duplicated entries found in the
  game manual. Since most people buying the game now won't get a manual, I
  am attempting to add in more of this information.


  Some jargon...

  PC    = Player Character
  NPC   = Non-Player Character, everyone who isn't you
  BG    = Baldur's Gate
  TotSC = Tales of the Sword Coast

  "Force-Talk" is when you initiate dialogue rather than wait for a character
          to speak to you. When the person is in your party, you have to use
          the button on the toolbar (default key: F1) to do so.
  "Force-Attack" is when you attack a non-hostile NPC or creature. This is
          done with the button on the toolbar (default key: F2) or by clicking
          on your equipped weapon on the toolbar, then clicking the NPC /
          creature.

  x,y   = I use a coordinate system in the walkthrough. It is listed in pixels
          on the terrain map. x 0, y 0 is the very top left. So, x 1000, y 1000
          is 1000 pixels to the "east" (or right) and 1000 pixels to the south
          (or down). You can find the coordinates by pressing the L key. This
          will tell you what the x,y values are at your mouse.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. The Modern Baldur's Gate Installation                            [ITWKNG]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This section covers both unofficial patches, and even more unofficial
  "tweaks."  It has been a long, long time since Bioware has released anything
  official for BG1.  Which has left the door wide open for some fan
  modifications (mods)!

  There are three general categories of mods:

    1. Unofficial patches. This merely tries to fix what was broken before.
       Maybe a quest was bugged, or an item didn't work the way its description
       was written. But the patch keeps things basically as the developers
       intended.
    2. Gameplay tweaks and restorations. In the second category, something is
       altered. The best example of this is the Baldur's Gate II tweak that
       restores the Grandmastery specialization perk to how it was in Baldur's
       Gate I.
    3. New content. And finally, there is new content. Could be new monsters,
       a new quest, some new travelling buddies, or even a new talking sword.

  You can find a great assortment of all of these here:

    http://modlist.pocketplane.net/

  And a lot of new content mods here:

    http://www.spellholdstudios.net/

  I have long enjoyed the Baldurdash unofficial patch for Baldur's Gate (as
  well as his later work on Oblivion). Further work has been done on the
  tweak front, and I'm currently using the BG1 Tweak pack from Gibberlings 3.

    http://www.gibberlings3.net/

  A Modern Installation:
  ----------------------
    So, when I was installing BG on my new computer, I knew for sure that I
    didn't want to play in 640x480. My current monitor is widescreen, for
    starters, and native in 1680x1050. Now, the Baldur's Gate II engine has
    support for 800x600 and “support” for even higher resolutions than that.
    Essentially what we are going to be doing is playing Baldur's Gate I in the
    Baldur's Gate II engine. So, obviously both games must be installed for any
    of this to work.

    What we are using today is called Baldur's Gate Trilogy (WeiDU version).
    Instead of creating a new BG1 game that uses the BG2 engine, BGT
    adds the BG1 data to BG2. That means you start a new game in Candlekeep
    and play continuously through all of BG1, BG2 and into Throne of Bhaal.
    This eliminates the need to transfer your character. You can find "BGT" at
    the Spellhold Studios link above.

    Also from pocketplane I grab the BG1 Unfinished Business tweak pack. This
    restores some of the “cut content” that Bioware had worked on but removed
    before release.

    Then from Gibberlings 3, I install the BG1 Tweak pack, the Widescreen
    mod, eScript (for updated AI behavior for my companions), and the BG1 NPC
    Project (for vastly better companion interactions), and the Oversight mod.
    With the Widescreen mod, I can set my game resolution to whatever I want,
    so I first tried full-screen at 1680x1050! I found that made my characters
    too small on the screen, so I changed it to 1280x800.

    I mostly went for things from the bugfix and tweak categories, leaving out
    many mods that add new content.

    The installation has a few minor quirks, so here is the installation order
    that I used:

      1. Install BG1 & TotSC
           Note: To avoid any problems with Windows, I always install in a non-
                 standard place, such as C:\games\Baldur's Gate\
      2. Patch TotSC
      3. Install BG2 & ToB
      4. Patch ToB
      5. Install Oversight
      6. Install BG2 Fixpack (MUST be installed before BGT)
      7. Install Ascension (MUST be installed before BGT)
      8. Install Turnabout
      9. Install BGT
      10. Install bg1npc
      11. Install BG1UB
      12. Install Unfinished Business
      13. Install BG2 Tweaks (do not install faster cutscenes and dreams)
      14. Install Widescreen

    Note: Both Baldur's Gate Trilogy and TuTu have a rather nasty bug
          when you leave Beregost. On occasion it will crash your game and
          corrupt your save-game. It is vital that you create a save before you
          enter Beregost (I just keep one, and call it “Pre-Beregost Save”),
          and another test save for when you leave Beregost (“Post-Beregost
          Save”). Once you have left Beregost and saved it, immediately reload
          that save. If it loads then congratulations you didn't get the bug!

    When you have finished BG1 using Trilogy, you just talk to Duke Eltan again
    and he sends you on a mission that starts BG2.

  Baldur's Gate TuTu (EasyTutu)
  -----------------------------
    Alternatively there is “EasyTutu”. From the pocketplane link above, this
    program melds together the Baldur's Gate 1 data with the Baldur's Gate 2
    engine. This gets you the advanced classes, kits, spells, etc. from the
    sequel, right within the first game. Requires both games installed on
    your computer already. EasyTutu already includes the unofficial patches.

    It still creates a separate game program from Baldur's Gate II. So once
    you are done playing in Baldur's Gate I, you still export your game to
    Baldur's Gate II as normal.

    Note: If you want to use “3d accelerating” you will want to install the
          green water fix immediately after installing EasyTutu.

  The Big Picture
  ---------------
    Found at Spellhold Studios, TBP is designed around BGT and getting every
    mod included and compatible. It adds a lot of new, fan-created content.

  Note: If you use either Tutu or BGT, you will need to use the x key to find
        the x,y coordinates instead of the L key.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iii. Creating a Character                                            [IIICRT]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Creating a Character is the most important thing that you do in the game.
  Period.  This has an effect on everything else in the game.  If you do it
  well, you will succeed and easily, if you do it poorly, you will have a much
  harder time of it, and possibly even fail.

  So let's run down the basics of creating a character:

    Gender:  This doesn't matter, except as a personal choice.

    Race:  I usually take a Human here as they are good all around.  It should
           be noted that there are considerable benefits to taking other races,
           such as Elves getting a bonus to Dexterity (a Max of 19) and Dwarves
           getting a bonus to Constitution (a Max of 19), but they also have
           drawbacks; such as Elves having a Max Constituion of 17 and Dwarves
           having a Max Dexterity of 17.

           Also if you want to be a Multi-Class character, you should probably
           take Half-Elf.  Personally, I would avoid Multi-Class characters, as
           they take longer to level up, and are usually weaker to start with.

           So, I'd take a human.

    Class:  Here, I'd take Fighter.  They level up well, and have good all
            around fighting abilities.  If you take a Ranger or a Paladin, you
            get a couple bonus abilities, but it takes longer to level up,
            which just isn't worth it to me.  And since you get Special
            Abilities anyway (see General Strategies below), you don't really
            need to be a Cleric.  Imoen is a good thief, and she pretty much
            starts with you, so you don't need to be a thief.

            So, I'd be a Fighter.

            Note:  Even if you start out as a Fighter, as long as you are
                   human, you don't have to stay a fighter! You can "dual
                   class" and pick up some other skills. Once you are level
                   2 you click on "dual class", pick a new class and you will
                   then switch over. Once your new class level is higher than
                   your old class level, you regain your old skills as well.

    Alignment:  Go with Lawful Good.  This starts your reputation at 12, and
                reputation is a good thing to have in abundance. (it makes
                items purchased in shops cheaper) You can find your reputation
                in your character record screen (default key: R).

                Alternatively, you could go with an evil party, but keep the
                reputation above 6 or the guards will start to attack you
                wherever you go. You can also run an evil party at high
                reputations, but if you go past 18 rep, evil companions will
                hit the road. Conversely, at very low reputations (2 or below)
                good companions will leave you.

    Abilities:  This is the most important part of character creation!  You
                have to try to get the best stats that you can possibly get,
                and the only way to do that is to re-roll constantly.  How good
                your stats get mostly depends on how patient you are in
                re-rolling.  You can customize your stats, if you want.  Simply
                decrease the amount in one stat, and use those points to
                increase another stat.

                First, decide what you want your main character to do. Front-
                line fighter or backline ranged. You will get a party of 6
                (5 others and yourself) eventually, and for balance, you will
                want at least 3 up front and 3 in the back. Since I think there
                are very good NPC archers already, and not as good options at
                front-line, I play a melee fighter.

                If you are a fighter here are some recommended minimum stats to
                try for:

                  STR:  18/51  -- affects melee ability to hit and damage
                  DEX:  11*    -- affects armor class, and ranged hit & damage
                  CON:  18**   -- affects HP
                  INT:  10     -- used for spells and lore (mage)
                  WIS:  10     -- used for spells and lore (cleric, druid)
                  CHA:  18     -- affects quest rewards and store prices

                  *  DEX can be low because of the Gauntlets of Dexterity, see
                     General Strategies below. However, this uses your bracers
                     slot so you wouldn't be able to use the Gauntlets of
                     Weapon Focus / Specialization. You can also try dropping
                     INT and WIS more to boost DEX.

                  ** CON adds a certain amount of HP per level gained. If you
                     gain enough CON you will not only gain more HP next level,
                     but you will also gain all the HP you would have gained
                     retroactively as well. e.g. I'm level 5 and use the manual
                     of bodily health to increase my CON from 18 to 19. I
                     instantly gain 5 HP. You cannot use a potion on level up
                     to trick the game into giving you more HP, once the potion
                     wears off, the HP are lost.

                  A Fighter who doesn't want to use the Gauntlets of Dexterity
                  might look like this:

                  STR:  18/00***
                  DEX:  18
                  CON:  18
                  INT:   7
                  WIS:   8
                  CHA:   9 (18 if you can get it)

                  *** The strength score comes in many flavors of "18." Non-
                      fighters will cap at just 18. Then there are the 18/01
                      to 18/00 scores. Think of 18/00 as 18 and 100, as it is
                      the highest, and 18/01 is the lowest.

                  Make sure not to neglect Charisma!  It's more important than
                  you might think (stores sell things cheaper, and people may
                  treat you better).  Of course, you can just cast Friends on
                  yourself to become more... Charismatic. If you don't care
                  about that, just give yourself max Dex and drop Charisma.
                  That's why they call it a "dump stat."

                  Once set, your stats will remain the same throughout the
                  entire game.

                  Tip: There are several books in the game that raise your
                       attributes. The physical books are called Manuals (like
                       the Manual of Bodily Health that raises CON by +1), and
                       the mental books are called Tomes. These are the only
                       ways to increase your stats. If you are going to export
                       your character to BG2, you should use the books only on
                       yourself.

                If you aren't a Fighter, then drop STR and improve the stat
                most associated with your ability.  INT for mages, WIS for
                clerics and druids, DEX for thieves and archers (rangers).

    Skills:  These are your proficiency points.  Think of it as which weapons
             your character is skilled in.  Based on which class you are, set
             two points to that characters likely primary weapon:

               Fighter, Paladin -- Large Sword
               Thief            -- Small Sword
               Ranger           -- Bow
               Mage             -- Missile Weapons (for slings)

             Then give the other points to either Bow or Missile Weapons.

             Note:  If you are a Ranger, then you also have to select your
                    Racial Enemy here.  I'd take Spider, as they seem to be
                    most prolific.

    Appearance:  Whatever you think looks good.

    Name:  Whatever you think sounds good.  Check out Appendix D. Guide to
           Naming Characters if you need some ideas.

iv. Items                                                            [IVTMSS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  Prices are all based on an average reputation, where they neither give
       you the "Hero's Discount" or the "Villain's Markup".  These prices were
       also based on a "Super Charisma", that is, two over 18.  To get a Super
       Charisma start by having 18, and then wear Algernon's Cloak.  And if you
       find a Tome of Leadership and Influence (Charisma +1), you can get up to
       21 Charisma.  The worse your Charisma, the higher these prices will be!

Note:  Prices are also dependent on supply. If a store already has an item that
       you are selling, they will give you a lesser price than they would if it
       was the first of that item that they saw. So, if you have 3 Plate Mails,
       sell them all at once to maximize the profit. The exception to this are
       gems, which keep their value.

Note:  Mage Scrolls are listed in section iv. Spells, wheras Cleric Scrolls are
       listed here. (this is because you can Write Magic from a Mage Scroll but
       cannot from a Cleric)

Note:  Although Inns are open 24 hours a day, many shops close during the
       night.

Note:  Your alignment affects how expensive Raise Dead is going to cost for
       you, depending on the temple that you are in.  If you are an Evil
       character in a Good Temple, it will be quite expensive (10000 gp).

  _____
  Shops (a * indicates that this item is only found in the Expansion Pack)
  ¯¯¯¯¯
    There are four types of business (or "shop")

      - Store (Buy and Sell)

        - ****Inn (Drink, Peasant, Merchant, Noble and Royal rooms)
      - Temple (Healing, Donate, Buy and Sell, Identify)

    All temple priests will identify items and so will some store owners.
    There are some stores you can steal from.  Stolen (fenced) items cannot be
    sold.

  Wands
  ¯¯¯¯¯
    Wands last for 20 uses, and then fizzle away.  Although no way exists to
    directly check how many charges are left in a wand, you can try to sell
    it at a shop.  The more the shopkeeper will pay, the more charges you have
    left.  You can also use the shopkeeper to recharge the wand, simply sell it
    to him, and then buy it back. The cost of the wand is dependent on the
    number of charges left, so this is a situation where you sell low and buy
    high.

    I've listed the selling prices here so that you can prioritize what to keep
    and what to toss if your inventory gets too cluttered.  Never keep anything
    silver, they are far too common and almost worthless. Unless you get a
    quest for a gem, just sell them. You can't make items out of gems, or
    upgrade items.

    Ankheg Shells -- can be made into an armor (AC 1), which costs 4000gp
      (Thunderhammer Smithy, Beregost).  Or you could sell them for 500gp.

      Note:  You can only sell shells once!  After that you can't even get him
             to make you an armor!  Sell the shells one at a time (by dropping
             the others) to get 500GP each.  You can even go back and get some
             more but Thunderhammer will stop buying shells and refuse to make
             the armor 10 days after he first offered to buy the shells or as
             soon as you get him to make the armor. (info from Duncan Clay)

      Tip:  There are 9 shells in the Akheg nest, turn up with these and the
            armor won't cost you anything.

    Wyvern Heads -- give the first to Keldath Ormlyr (priest at temple) for
      2000 gp, then sell any others to Thalantyr (mage at high hedge, or
      elsewhere) for 500 gp each, and drops down to 200 gp.  Officer Vai will
      buy heads for 1000 gp each, however this lasts only as long as she is
      still in Beregost.

    Winter Wolf Pelts -- sell these in the shop in Nashkel for 500gp each, no
      limit to how many you can sell.  You can also sell these to Officer Vai
      (at least as long as she is accepting Scalps) After she has gone you can
      sell them at Feldpost Inn for 25GP which will drop to 10GP.

vi. Companions                                                       [VINPCS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless it is otherwise mentioned, any NPC you say "no" to (or remove later)
will stay put wherever you put them.  To see the X,Y coordinate of where you
are, press "L".  The top left of any map is (x 0 y 0). (If you are using Tutu
or Baldur's Gate Trilogy, use the X key to find the coordinates)

Special Abilities are those abilities that that character intrinsicly has.
Some of them they have before they join you, others they gain later.

Note: If you turn both Khalid and Jaheira down in the FAI, you can't ever get
      them to join.

Pairs: (you can't have one without the other)
    Khalid --  Jaheira
    Xzar   --  Montaron
    Minsc  --  Dynaheir
    Eldoth --  Skie

  Note: To get one of these in the pair without the other, simply send the
        other person into a building (the person you want to get rid of), and
        then reform the party to kick them out.  This way they can't come up to
        you and talk to you.

Here's the party I like:

  You      -- as a Lawful Good Fighter
  Kivan    -- give him a Composite Long Bow +1, or the Long Bow of
              Marksmanship, and the Bracers of Archery; and you have a really
              effective sniper.
  Minsc    -- a very good warrior, and amusing too!
  Dynaheir -- a good mage, plus if you get her at the right level, she starts
              with Fireball.  Edwin is a better mage (higher Int, and better
              special ability), however, he is Evil which complicates things.
  Viconia  -- or sub in Branwen if you don't want to worry about your rep.
  Imoen    -- you need a thief, and you start with her. If you want a better
              archer, sub in Coran. Alternatively, you can dual-class Imoen to
              mage around level 5 or 6, drop Dynaheir and pick up Coran that
              way.

And here are some interesting party combinations:

  Have Minsc, Dynaheir and Edwin in the same party.  Since Edwin wants to kill
  Dynaheir, Minsc gets all surly and protective.

  Viconia and Kivan have a love-hate relationship, and also Viconia is very
  dimissive about Xan.

  Put Yeslick and Kagain together to see just how different two Dwarves can be.
  Yeslick DESPISES Kagain.

  Safana and Coran.  Coran will flirt shamelessly with Safana, and she will
  rebuff his every attempt, quite humorously.

  Quayle and Tiax.  These two really don't like each other.  Plus they're
  fairly amusing on their own.

  Faldorn and Jaheira don't like each other either, as they belong to opposing
  druidic groups.

  Put Eldoth, Skie, and Garrick together for a wild Love Triangle.  Heh.

And now the BIG LIST of every NPC complete with a description, and where they
are.  This list is sorted by alignment, Good first, then Neutral, then Evil
last.

GOOD:          S  D  C  I  W  Ch       Race        Class           Alignment

  Ajantis      17 13 16 12 13 17      Human       Paladin         Lawful Good

      Ajantis is a simple person, all he wants to do is vanquish evil.

      Where he is:  Farm N of Friendly Arm Inn (x 1572 y 3139)

  Dynaheir     11 13 16 17 15 12      Human       Invoker         Lawful Good

      Dynaheir was kidnapped by the Gnolls, and must be rescued with Minsc in
      your party.  She is also linked to Minsc and if one leaves, the other
      does too.  She makes a good mage because she already knows such spells as
      Fireball. (depending on the level you get her)
      Dynaheir will disappear if you reject her offer to join.
      Special Abilities: Slow Poison
      Where she is:  Gnollish Stronghold (x 2529 y 1440)

  Yeslick      15 12 17 7  16 10      Dwarf      Fighter/Cleric   Lawful Good

      How noble.  If you reject him he will leave forever.
      Special Abilities:  Dispel Magic
      Where he is:  Cloakwood Mines, Level 2 (x 851 y 1727)

  Imoen        9  18 16 17 11 16      Human        Thief         Neutral Good

      Imoen automatically will join you immediately after Gorion's death.
      Unless you run away, that is.  Sometimes she comes with a Wand of Magic
      Missiles, now who did she steal that from?

  Khalid       15 16 17 12 10 9      Half-Elf      Fighter       Neutral Good

      See Jaheira below for a description.
      Where he is:  Friendly Arm Inn, Ground Floor (x 329 y 685)

  Minsc     18/93 15 15 8  6  9       Human        Ranger        Neutral Good

      Minsc's bonded witch, Dynaheir, was kidnapped by Gnolls, and he wants
      your help to get her back!  If you don't rescue her in a timely fashion,
      Minsc will leave.
      Special Abilities: Berserk, Charm Animal
      Where he is: Nashkel (x 3387 y 1957)

  Alora        8  19 12 14 7  10     Halfling       Thief        Chaotic Good

      You'll find Alora burglarizing the Hall of Wonders at night.  Agree to
      stand watch for her, then talk to her twice more and she'll offer to
      join.
      Where she is: Baldur's Gate W Section (AR 0600, x 1600 y 2200)

  Coran        14 20 12 14 9  16     Half-Elf    Fighter/Thief   Chaotic Good

      Coran wants to go sack some Wyverns in the 4th Cloakwood forest, so do
      that immediately or he will leave.  After you beat the wyverns, he will
      stay forever.
      Where he is:  Cloakwood 1, On a Bridge (x 1515 y 691)

  Kivan     18/12 17 14 10 14 8        Elf        Ranger         Chaotic Good

      Kivan wants to hunt some bandits.  If you kick him out of the party, he
      stays gone for good!
      Special Abilities: Charm Animal
      Where he is:  High Hedge (x 3652 y 1472)


NEUTRAL:       S  D  C  I  W  Ch       Race        Class           Alignment

  Xan          13 16 7  17 14 16       Elf       Enchanter      Lawful Neutral

      Xan is a depressing person, but he is a capable mage (although he has the
      very large flaw of not being able to cast such spells as Magic Missile
      and Fireball!) and he has a Moonblade.  If you're overly rude to him
      he'll leave and never return.
      Where he is:  Nashkel Mines Interior (Fourth Level, Cave  x 793 y 588)

  Branwen      13 16 15 9  16 13      Human       Cleric         True Neutral

      To get Branwen in your party all you have to do is to free her from the

NPC Resetting: (from Sergio D. Morozov, SergioMorozov@Yandex.Ru)
--------------

  Anywhere in the game. I have encountered the following feature during
  playing:

   * IF party recruits an NPC
   * AND does not get sufficient XP after that
   * AND leaves that NPC somewhere
   * AND does not visit that place for some time
   * AND gets sufficient XP during absence from the area in which NPC was left
   * THEN that NPC may (or may not) “refresh” to one of the predefined .cre
     entities (of higher level than NPC was when left alone), thus robbing
     the party of any items left on him/her and giving default items instead.
     NPCs dialogue will also be reset or moved to some unpredictable point
     during this (Such as Kivan will accuse you of not helping him find Bandit
     Camp even if you never spoke about “Camp”, only of “Bandits”).

  I have experienced this with Kivan left in Nashkel and Khalid left in Nashkel
  Barracks (Khalid robbed me of Short Sword +1 which he stole from a chest in
  that very place before retirement.) Also if party turns Branwen from stone to
  flesh, but does not speak to her, next time she might be petrified again
  (possibly went to find Tranzig on her own and succeeded, he-he-he).

  Of course this may not be considered a bug, because NPCs must not stay put
  and may adventure, and get XP, and sell items, and spend GP on their own. But
  this is a nasty “realistic” feature, which should be taken into
  consideration.

  Also I had Montaron and Xzar staying in Beregost for a LONG time and they did
  not change levels or equipment, although my party received six levels while
  they (M & X) enjoyed Beregost's luxury.

___________________________________
Play as Multiplayer, even if Alone:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  It is quite beneficial to play every game as a multiplayer (although it does
  create a bit of a hassle).  It gives you the benefit of being able to create
  all 6 players in your party rather than depending on NPC's, and you can also
  Export and Import characters in and out at any time.  To create a Multiplayer
  game just click the Multi Player button.  At the next menu click "Connect".
  Now you have to set the type of Multi Player (the top button), using Serial
  is fairly easy (although it requires that you have some Networking
  installed...) Now click "Create Game" (whenever you are playing by yourself
  in the Multiplayer always use "Create Game", never use "Join Game"!).  Name
  the session to whatever you want, and enter in your own name.  Finally click
  "New Game".  Now you can create as many characters as you want.  Then once
  they are all created, click the little skull icon by each created characters,
  and then click the "Done" button.  Voila!

  Note:  Another good effect of playing in the Multiplayer is that you can look
         at your inventory while paused!

________________________
Charisma is your friend:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  So what does Charisma really get you?  Well if you have a low charisma you
  may not be able to get NPC's to join you, if you pass a quest, the treasure
  may not be as good as it normally would be, (or there may be no treasure at
  all!) and shops WILL charge you more.  So don't skimp out on the charisma.

__________________________
Low Dexterity, Not So Bad?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  If your stats just aren't turning out so good, consider skimping on
  Dexterity.  Why?  There are Gaunlets of Dexterity out there that bring you up
  to a full 18!  Don't skimp out too much since as you still have to fight to
  get those gauntlets.  You can find the Gauntlets at the entrance to the
  Gnollish Stronghold (see the Nashkel and Gnollish Stronghold sections for
  more information).  And if you skimp out on a LOT of Dexterity you will want
  to get down there as soon as possible!  The downside of this strategy is if
  you find a Book that increases your Dexterity, it will increase your old
  Dexterity.  So if you had a 3 before, and an 18 with the Gauntlets, you'll
  get a 4 base and still have 18.

  On the other hand...

  Don't skimp out on dexterity since it gives two things:  First, a character
  with a high dexterity starts with a lower AC (which is better). The extra
  points of AC that early in the game are very helpful. Second, you burn your
  gauntlets slot on your character which you can use to wear the Gauntlets of
  Weapon Specialization which gives a bonus to hit and damage.

  Note: Contrary to what most people believe, DEX has no effect on your melee
        ability to hit. It only affects AC, thieving skills and ranged attacks.

________________________________________
Duncan Clay's Party Recruitment Strategy
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Straight away I recommend recruiting anyone you bump in to until your
  group reaches six members as this keeps your XP low! - Yes, low!  You
  should try and pick up all your party members before you have more than
  1000XP (don't kill anything unless absolutely necessary).  This allows
  you to shape their development (particularly thieves and fighters) but
  rules out any NPCs you can't meet until after Cloakwood.

  My party is made up of
  2 tough fighters for the front lines
  2 archers for support
  2 thieves - 1 to specialise in traps and locks and 1 for pickpocket
  (stealth is done with clothing)
  1 cleric for first aid
  1 mage to use all those scrolls
  1 charismatic person with Algernon's Cloak for group leader

  That's 9 people, so how is it done.
       Me - Fighter
   Khalid - Fighter (no choice since he is the only non-evil fighter you
            can give 5 proficiency points to)
    Kivan - Stealthy Archer
  Branwen - Cleric (because you can get her early)
   Safana - Charismatic Thief and Archer (since thieves have high DEX it
            makes them good archers)
    Imoen - Thief

  So where's the Mage?  Well there are no NPC Mages, only specialist
  mages.

  This is the clever bit.  There are only two NPCs in the whole game that
  can Dual-Class, Imoen and Shar-Teel.

  ( Dual-Class reminder                                             )
  ( You must be human and not a Paladin or Bard                     )
  ( You must have 15 in you first class and 17 in your second class )

  Most people say Imoen is rubbish because she has a strength of 9 (not
  much good as a stealthy backstabbing assassin).
  However her total point of 87 is one of the highest in the game and she
  also has an INT of 17 (which I believe was no coincidence by the game
  designers - why else would a thief need a high INT?).

  With an XP limit of 89,000 (in BG) you must dual-class Imoen by level 6
  if she is to become a level 7 Mage/Thief.  I dual-classed her at level 5
  (10,000XP) as by then she had 3x backstab and 100% pickpocket and her skills
  as a Mage/Thief would be available earlier in the game (at a total of
  50,000XP).  Don't forget to assign proficiency points to different weapons
  as a Mage because the Thief ones will become available once she reaches
  level 6 (i.e. they are not cumulative so if you give 1 to missile as a
  thief and 1 to missile as a mage you will only have 1 for missile as a mage
  thief whereas you could have had 1 for bow AND 1 for missile).

_________________
Fighting Battles:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Let them come to you.  When you first see an enemy, your first instinct may
  be to run over to it and slaughter it.  Well don't.  Let it come to you, and
  attack it there.  This way if there are 50 more of these creatures, they
  won't see you and won't attack.  You can then pick off each creature one at a
  time.  This is especially useful in dungeons where the enemies may be more
  difficult.  So when you first see an enemy (let's say that it's a Battle
  Horror), turn off the AI (it's the left button in the bottom right corner of
  the screen), and let him come up to you.  You should also have your
  archers/mages hit the enemy with everything they can, but don't move any
  closer to the enemy!  The last thing that you want is to fight TWO Battle
  Horrors at the same time!

  Also realize that some monsters (like Vampiric Wolves) require that you hit
  them with Magic Weapons.  You should never use Magic Arrows on a normal
  creature; you should save the arrows for enemies that need them, such as
  Battle Horrors, Demonknights, etc.

  Area spells can take out a lot of enemies without them even knowing that you
  are there.  Suppose for a moment, that you are walking along, and a Gnoll
  comes to attack you.  You immediately stop, wait for him to come to you and
  kill him.  Well, where there is one Gnoll there are probably more, so you
  launch a fireball in the direction that the Gnoll came from, and immediately
  hear the screams of dying Gnolls.  This is a great way to cut enemies down
  quickly, but you probably want to save your fireballs for bigger enemies than
  the common Gnoll. (fry the Dryads instead!)  Another good example is if you
  are attacked by an NPC assassin of some sort.  If you are out in the wild,
  it's likely that there is a party of them, so you launch a Fireball (or a
  Cloudkill) and kill them before they even know you exist.

________________________________________________
Fighting Sirines (and other "Charm"ing monsters)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  (from Gonzalo Jéldrez)

  I had some trouble fighting the three sirines (Sil) in the Lighthouse, but I
  casually discovered a good technique: I sent Minsc alone to the combat with
  Berserk activated, and when the Dryads charmed him, he continued attacking
  them! He killed the three of them, but of course lost the 15 hp for
  berserking.  I don't know if the rest of the party needs to be far away from
  the combat, anyway.

  Editor's Note: I use a variation of this strategy a fair amount. Sirines are
                 deadly because they can cast Dire Charm, and turn one of your
                 party against you. Nothing worse than watching your best
                 fighter mow down your mage in a round. So, I just send in my
                 best fighter all alone. If she does get Dire Charmed, the
                 Sirines will stop attacking, so she remains completely safe.

__________________________________
Monsters are constantly respawning
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  In some areas, monsters will keep respawning even if you kill them all.
  Sometimes, you can actually determine that monsters are respawning in the
  same general area in a map.  Let's use an example:  The Gnoll Fortress.
  Here, Gnolls keep respawning and always in the same spot; and, when
  respawned, they do not move or wander around aimlessly.  So, once you have
  determined an area where they respawn, get rid of them and leave a character
  there.  Monsters do not respawn if there is a character within eyesight
  (if a character is in the area and could immediately see the respawned
  monster).  So, you can leave a couple of weak characters in those areas while
  the others handle the beating.

  There are some areas where this strategy will not work, though.  In Werewolf
  Island, Werewolves will keep respawning even within eyesight of your
  character (it is not a good idea to leave a low level mage where 4 Werewolves
  will be respawned when you will load a game).  Another example is the
  Firewine Bridge Ruins.  Although the Kobolds Commandos do not respawn when
  you can see them, there are a lot of places where they actually
  respawn and because when respawned, they wander around aimlessly so you can't
  leave a character behind -- unless he's prepared to fight some Kobolds
  Commandos every now and then.

____________________________
Useful spells and tough NPCs
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  When fighting 2 or more difficult NPCs (assassination attempts come to
  mind), use the Charm spell to quickly turn the odds in your favor.  If you
  have two magic users who can cast charm in the first round of a fight, not
  only does the enemy lose two characters, you gain them temporarily (so the
  odds can change from 10 enemies vs. 6 of you to 8 enemies and 8 of you).
  Once they are charmed, pull back your big bruisers from the front lines and
  replace them by the newly acquired members while continually pelting the
  remaining enemies with ranged weapons.  If any charmed characters survive the
  encounter, simply force-attack them to get rid of them.  If you have Dire
  Charm, use that instead of the regular Charm.

  Also, the spell Entangle (or Web) is pretty useful to stop those annoying
  fighters with melee weapons from closing in on your party.  Once entangled,
  they can't move and you can get rid of them easily and safely with ranged
  weapons.  The spell Web is also good since a webbed creature can't even
  attack with a ranged weapon, but the spell can last for several rounds and
  could eventually web some of your own party members from round to round if
  they get in the affected area.

  Lightning Bolt, however, is a pretty crappy spell.  Although it deals a lot
  of damage, it will usually hit a wall and come right back at the person who
  cast it.  I've gotten rid of some enemy mages that way (the mage in
  Firewine, and Davaeorn and Rieltar come to mind).  They cast Lightning Bolt
  at my characters, I'm hit once, but move out of the way while they get hit
  repeatedly by his own lightning bolt reflecting off the walls, as well as my
  characters. Unless you are outdoors, don't use or memorize lightning bolt.

  Monsters summoning is a great spell.  Although the summoned monsters do not
  do a lot of damage, they make great cannon fodder. Charge!  While they keep
  the enemy busy, you can pick them off one by one with ranged weapons or
  spells (saving all your potions, and more potent spells for later more
  powerful enemies).  When fightings werewolves in Balduran's Shipwreck or
  the Aec'Letec are great examples of where to use this spell.

  Fireballs and those other major area effect spells should be used only to
  weaken the enemy or for luring them to you and thus, do not memorize a lot
  of these (memorize others instead).  These major area effect spells, when
  not cast at the right place, can literally damage your whole party so unless
  you know exactly where to cast them, don't use them.  Keep them instead for
  when an area is completely filled with a group of weaker enemies to get rid
  of them quickly and with minimal damage (happens when you quickloads or loads
  a lot of times in the same map).  The Crypts below Candlekeep is a good
  example of this (I once had 40+ skeletons archers pounding my fighter). Two
  fireballs got all of them.  Fighting them any other way would have caused
  unnecessary damage to almost all my party members.

  Memorize a lot of Dispel Magic spells.  Dispel Magic negates any magic
  affecting your party (fear, horror, paralysis, entangle, slow, etc...) while
  it can also be used to dispel the enemy magics that they use (haste, minor
  globe of invulnerability, protection from normal missiles, etc...).  Never
  forget that casting dispel magic will negates both magics affecting your
  party and the enemy so knowing when to cast what spell when is crucial in an
  important battle.  Usually, though, it is preferable to dispel everyones
  magic's than having one or more of your party members being paralysed,
  charmed, running in fear, etc...

________________________________________
Lure the enemy to you (especially NPC's)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  This is a good tactic to use in battles with enemy NPC's.  Keep your party
  away from the future battle ground and move only one of your character near
  the enemy's NPCs.  When one of them see your character, quickly pull him back
  toward your main group then let the poor little dude get it.  This way, you
  can chunk out some annoying NPCs before you tackle the rest (the group of
  mercenaries in the Eldercity and the last battle with Sarevok and friends
  come to mind).

______________________________
Skeletons and Stinking Clouds:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  (from John Van De Graaf)

  A very effective strategy is to have your cleric summon a group of skeletons
  to accompany the party around an area since the skeletons last 8 hours,
  which is a lot more time than other summoned critters.  In an encounter with
  a group of foes, have your mage cast the under-appreciated Stinking Cloud
  spell on the enemy group and send your skeletons in to fight.  Your party
  can stand back and kill everyone with missile fire.  The skeletons aren't
  affected by stinking cloud, charm, confusion, or any of the annoying mental
  spells that enemies tend to use.  This tactic is particularly good against
  mental attack creatures like Sirines and mindflayers, stone-gaze creatures
  like medusae and basilisks, and against enemy mages who expend their spell
  on your undead minions.  The stinking cloud makes it nearly impossible for
  enemy mages to cast spells anyway.  Enemy fighters can beat up the skeletons
  pretty handily, whenever they're not passed out from the stinking cloud, but
  even then, you get to do a lot of damage with missile fire before the enemy
  fighters close in to any of your party.  The best part is, both Stinking
  Cloud and Summon Skeleton are very low level spells and so are available
  very early in the game, when you most need such advantages.

___________
Save a Lot:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  There are 3 times when you should definately save the game.  When you win a
  battle, before you go to sleep, and everywhere else.  You never know when you
  will go to a new area, have your best warrior charmed, and have half your
  party killed.  So save often.  Also don't just save over the same slot over
  and over, use at least 10 slots.  This is especially necessary in Durlag's
  tower.  This also means you should probably avoid the Quick Save.  Well...
  not avoid, just don't use it exclusively.

  What I would do is to create an "Archive Save" whenever you enter a new major
  area.  So when you start Durlag's Tower create a "Durlag's Beginning Save" so
  if you screw up, you can start over from the start of the tower.

________
Resting:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  No matter where you rest, you won't get very many HP from resting.  In fact,
  for an 8 hour rest, everyone will get exactly 1 HP (unless they have 19 CON).
  So before you rest make sure to (after you save it, if you are not in an inn)
  heal everyone with spells.  You get all magic memorized during the night, you
  do not, however, get all your HP's.  In fact you only get 1 hp during a
  normal rest (you get more in an inn if you pay for the more expensive
  rooms).

__________
The Guard:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  When you rob someone, they might summon the guard.  Keep that in mind (you
  will want to save the game before you rob someone).  Also bear in mind that
  the guard is strangely NOT summoned if you kill someone, like in an inn.  To
  be more precise, the Guard is only summoned if you steal something with
  someone in the room who is able to summon the Guard.  I'm not saying that you
  should kill people so that you can rob their room, it's just that you can
  kill SOME people without the Guard caring.  How do they know that that person
  attacked you?

  In any case, if the Guard is summoned they will try to talk to you.  If you
  can get away without them talking to you, you have gotten off scot free (not
  as easy as it sounds).  You can't bribe them (at least you can't do it more
  than once), so tell them that you'll cleave them limb from limb, then simply
  leave the room.  Don't attack them!  Once you're out of the room you're fine,
  you can even come back later and they'll vanish.  This way you lose only 1
  reputation rather than the 5 or so you get by killing a Flaming Fist.

  edwardalacey sent me this:

    "Whether you can bribe guards depends on who exactly they are. If you steal
    in Beregost or Baldur's Gate the Flaming Fist will arrive, and they cannot
    be bribed. In Nashkel or the Carnival you get Amnish soldiers, who can be
    bribed with 200 gold. In Candlekeep a watcher will arrive and demand that
    you donate all your money to the library, and you are let off if you do
    this."

  You really want a high reputation.  The higher the better.  Even if you have
  an evil party you want a high reputation.  If you have a good or neutral
  party, try for a reputation of 20, if you have an evil party, you still want
  a reputation of 18 (the highest you can go before all the evil people start
  leaving).  Because of these various things, I would not recommend having a
  mixed alignment party.  By mixed I mean good and evil combined.  The best
  part about a good reputation is that everything is given the "hero discount",
  up to 50% off of items in stores! You can see your reputation in your
  character record screen, default key: R.

Stealing without Loss of Reputation:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  So you want to steal something from a house without losing reputation.  It
  is actually quite an easy thing to accomplish.  Simply de-equip your weapon,
  and whack all the people in the room until they are unconscious (be careful
  to not KILL the people, so turn off the AI, or de-equip everyone's weapons).
  Now you can steal anything you want.  Since they aren't awake to complain
  about it, you can't lose reputation.

  Use the games possibilities! Just IMMEDIATELY stop the game after you opened
  a chest or something, because the guard needs some time to show up. You can
  transfer all the stuff into your inventory while still being in PAUSE-mode.
  Then save it. Reload agan, and the announced guards will never appear. But
  the gained stuff is of course still of yours. (From Dr. Gummipress)

Cursed Protection scrolls
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  To give you an idea if the Protection from XXXXXX Scroll that you just found
  is cursed, give it to a character with a high Lore Ability (they can normally
  identify these scrolls without any magical means) and right click on it.
  If the scroll is still not identified at that point (you still do not know
  what that scroll does) then it probably is a cursed scroll.  Another strategy
  is to keep one Identify spell memorized.  Simply save before you identify the
  scroll, identify it (so you know if it is cursed or not and if it is worth
  keeping) then reload.

______________
Cursed Potions
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  You may already have noticed this, but there are cursed potions in the game,
  which all have the same names as normal potions.  There are hints in their
  descriptions, but they are all clearly recognisable by their colours:  cursed
  healing potions are dark pink, antidotes are purple, and oils of speed are
  multi-coloured (as opposed to blue, green and white respectively).  The
  antidote in the pile of corpses in Ulcaster is cursed, as are all the potions
  Lucky Aello sells except the potion of perception. (from edwardalacey)

  Editor's Note: The one potion that looks cursed, but isn't, is the multi-
                 colored Potion of Invulnerability.

______________________
MartectX's strategies:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  - Stealing without Loss of Reputation: I got on this while trying to steal
    the Rogue Stone from the Hall of Wonders: Just charm all people around!
    They won't call any wardens.

  - If a NPC who is supposed to give you an important information or quest was
    threatened by you and turned "red" - charm him using Nymph's cloak (or
    Algernon's of course...) and force-talk to him. (default key: F1)

  - So you are fighting mighty NPMages? Like I described above do the
    following: Enter the room and the mage should begin casting a spell.
    Quickly run out and get straight back in. The mage will cast another spell
    and so you should get out again. Once the mage is out of his spells he'll
    direct you in hand-to-hand combat (where he should be a real dog-biscuit).
    This surely only functions if there's a "real" door, not only a hole in the
    wall - the game has to load another level, you get it?

    Editor's Note: This doesn't work with all mages. The ones in TotSC areas
                   particularly have scripts to prevent this. For instance,
                   they will have several spells that they never run out of,
                   and always recast when you enter the area (like globe
                   of invulnerability).

__________________
Special Abilities:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Your main character will gain new special abilities as you sleep.  The first
  couple are "Cure Light Wounds" (assuming that you have a good reputation).
  They come in the form of strange dreams, which usually occur at the beginning
  of new chapters (whether you sleep in an inn or not).  You are not guaranteed
  to gain an ability just because it's a new chapter and you are sleeping in an
  inn, however, it will happen eventually.

  So which of the two will your character gain, good or evil?  That depends on
  your Reputation (not your alignment).  If it is 10 or above, you get the good
  abilities, if it is less than 10 you get the evil abilities.  Reputation is
  checked at the time you have the "dream", not at the beginning of the
  chapter.                                                 (from Kelvin Groves)

             Good Abilities:                Evil Abilities:
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

                   Frequently Asked Questions    [FRQNTL]
===============================================================================

General:
--------

  Q:  Why aren't cheats working for me?

  A:  My guess is that it is something to do with Windows Vista / 7. I don't
      know this for sure as the cheats have always worked for me and I use
      Windows 7.

      I would recommend installing your game to a non-standard location. For my
      game I installed it to C:\Games\Baldur's Gate\.

      Then you activate cheats in the normal way by opening Baldur.ini (found
      in that same folder), find [Game Options] and beneath that adding the
      line:

        Cheats=1

      Save the Baldur.ini file and start your game. Cheats should work. See
      that section below for more information.

      Or, if you are using Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy, you open the same
      Baldur.ini file and find [Program Options]. Then add beneath that:

        Debug Mode=1

      Save and exit the text editor and fire up the game as normal.

  Q:  How do I read the coordinates you use? (x 100 y 200)

  A:  This is probably my most asked question, so I have placed the
      instructions for it in several other places throughout the guide. To
      display the x,y position at your mouse cursor press the L button.


  Q:  How do I use magic scrolls?

  A:  There are 3 types of magical scrolls: the Protection Scrolls (they have
      the green icons), mage spells and divine spells. Anyone can use
      protection scrolls. Only mages and bards can use mage scrolls, and only
      clerics, druids, paladins and rangers can use divine scrolls. To cast
      directly from the scroll, place it in your "Quick Item" slot on your
      inventory screen. Then select your character, and click on the toolbar
      button with the spell. With mage spells, if you right click on the spell,
      you can write the spell to your spellbook.


  Q:  I had enough experience to level up, I clicked the button, but now in
      the level-up screen, the "Accept" button is grayed out. How do I get past
      this?

  A:  You have to assign all available weapon proficiencies and theiving skill
      points before you can level up.


  Q:  Where are the stat improving tomes and manuals?

  A:  There are 8 stat improving books in the game.  One for each stat, except
      WISDOM which has 3. This is the only permanent way to improve your stats
      in the game. You can only get 3 of them before entering Baldur's Gate
      in chapter 5.

         Candlekeep for the Flaming Fist.
         /SPOILER
      ** Tales of the Sword Coast


  Q:  Why do my weapons keep breaking?

  A:  This is due to the "iron shortage." All non-magical weapons in the game
      have a chance to break. So, until you get your first "+1" weapon, keep
      some spares around.


Baldur's Gate:
--------------

  Q:  I was poisoned by Lothander and Marek, but both are now dead and I'm
      still poisoned. How do I get cured?

  A:  The cure is built into the quest, so you have to complete it properly to
      get cured. In order: you go to the central area of Baldur's Gate, talk
      to Lothander, talk to the Diviner, talk to the priestess of Umberlee,
      get the book from the priest of Tymora, back to the priestess of Umberlee
      to get the scroll of geas removal (you can fight her to keep the book),
      back to Lothander upstairs in the Blade & Star Inn (he gives you a
      regular potion of antidote), then to the blushing mermaid go upstairs
      to talk to Marek. This last part is key. You can't just attack him, you
      have to talk to him first. Kill him, get his antidote, drink it and
      you're done.


Durlag's Tower
--------------

  Q:  I can't figure out the 4 dwarven riddles, help!

  A:  They have 4 things for you to do, and their riddle is simply telling you
      what on the level you need to accomplish. This is made more tricky by the
      fact that you have to look for the "circular chasing arrows" icon to use
      the various items in the area.

        1) Find the mallet handle and mallet head, rebuild the mallet on the
           anvil, then strike the gone.
        2) Find the Glittering Beljuril.
        3) Click on all the books in the circular library, then observe the
           glory of Durlag's Pride (sword).
        4) Find the machine switch, put it on the slot above the big machine
           to reactivate the machine. Find the grapes. Go to the wine press,
           use it to make wine. Don't drink the wine.

      Once those are done, turn them in to the dwarves. They will attack you,
      kill them, search the bodies for the Dwarven Runestone, and be on your
      way.


  Q:  On the third level, I beat the second Durlag doppleganger in the sparring
      dummy room, but I can't get to the next room, the door is locked. How
      do I get in there?

  A:  Hit the each of the dummies once to open the doors.


  Q:  On the level with the 4 caverns with the 4 elemental monsters, I killed
      them all, but it doesn't transport me to the chess board. What did I
      miss?

  A:  You have to kill every monster in each cave. My guess is that you missed
      a Phoenix Guard in the fire cave. They can sometimes come back after you
      kill them (rise from the ashes, as it were).


===============================================================================
                          Baldur's Gate WALKTHROUGH:                 [WLKTHR]
===============================================================================

A quick note on locations:  To find out the location at the mouse cursor press
                            the "L" key.  The top left of the screen is the
                            0,0.  Some locations that I list are the buildings
                            that the people/things are in, when I do this I try
                            to get the location of the door.  So to find that
                            person/thing just go inside!

This is a sequential walkthrough, that is, it goes in the order that I went.  I
think that this is a good order, but you don't have to follow it.  All the
major places are the numbered sections, and the minor areas are represented by
the little lettered sections.  Feel free to do as many or as little of the
lettered sub-sections as you wish.

The Treasures line in each section lists only major treasures, such as magical
items.  It does not list all the treasures, like gold or gems, in the areas.  I
also don't list things like potions, and I know that I have missed some things
here and there, if you find any, please email me!

Note:  All of the subquest rewards were taken with a high (18 or so) Charisma.
       If your charisma is lower than this, you may get a significantly lesser
       reward!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Candlekeep                                                        [1CNDLK]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions (NPC's): none (although Imoen joins later)

Plot:
  - Buy Equipment in the Inn (you start right by it). If you want to do
    subquests here, buy some bolts while you're there (Fuller's Bolts).

  - The subquests here function as a tutorial of the games functions. They give
    a small amount of experience (xp) and gold, but aren't critical.

  - Once you're done here, talk to Gorion to leave Candlekeep (x 2683 y 1756)
    Note: Once you leave Candlekeep, you can't come back.

Subquests:
  - Phlydia's Book
    A little NE of the Inn, you will find Phlydia.  She has lost her book, The
    History of Halruaa.  Go east, you will find a shed with hay and a cow.
    Check one of the bales of hay for the book.  Return to Phlydia for your
    reward, a gem and 50 exp.

    Note: The quality of the gem depends on your "Reaction Roll" which is
          a combination of your Charisma (CHA) and Reputation (REP). If you
          have a bad CHA and a normal REP, you might not get a gem reward at
          all.

    Phlydia: Candlekeep (x 1601 y 311)
    Book: Candlekeep (x 3245 y 289)

  - Firebead's Scroll
    Inside the Inn is Firebead Elvenhair.  He has lent a scroll to a scholar,
    Tethtoril, near the Candlekeep central area and wants you to retrieve it.
    Do so for a small reward, a Healing Potion, 50 exp and he casts Protection
    from Evil on you. Speaking of evil...

      Josh Clue sent this exploit:
        "As an 'EASY Level Up' option before you venture out of Candlekeep, you
        can opt to kill the old mage for his worth in XP, 2700 to be exact. It
        is a bit tricky, but possible. Here is how: Buy all the items you will
        need before leaving with Gorion. Equip your character's ranged weapon,
        preferably a bow or sling. Make sure you have 60-80 arrows or bullets.
        After Firebead casts Protection From Evil on you, head for the foot of
        the stairs. Then, from that vantage point, attack him with your ranged
        weapon. He will begin casting, but you can interrupt it by heading up
        the flight of stairs. Head down again, fire once with your ranged
        weapon, then quickly head up before the completion of his spellcasting.
        Do this repeatedly and you will end up slaying the poor mage and
        gaining 2700 XP before you even set foot outside Candlekeep. This will
        make your main character level 2 or 3! Winthrop, the guests at the inn,
        and the tutors will become hostile but do not kill them. Grab
        Firebead's things and  either use them, or sell them to buy back your
        lost reputation."

    Firebead: Candlekeep, Candlekeep Inn (x 198 y 404)
    Tethtoril: Candlekeep (x 3154 y 1304)

  - Fuller's Bolts
    If you're still in the Inn, buy some bolts, and take them to the barracks.
    There you will give your bolts to Fuller who apparantly can't walk up the
    street to get some himself. (Or he's humoring you) When you talk to Fuller,
    ask him if he has any errands for you to run.  Talk to him again and give
    him the bolts for your reward, a dagger +1 and 50 exp.
    Barracks: Candlekeep (x 1570 y 2447)

  - Hull's Sword & Medicine
    While you are still in the barracks, in the NE corner is a chest.  Open the
    chest and take the contents (a sword, and a bottle).  Now take the sword
    to Hull, who is by the main gate.  Talk to him, and he'll tell you that he
    forgot his sword.  Talk to him again to give it to him.  You get 20gp and
    50 exp for your trouble.
    Barracks: Candlekeep (x 1570 y 2447)
    Hull: Candlekeep (x 3662 y 2431)

  - Nessie's Green Elixer
    Now we're going to finish up these subquests by going up to Nessie (the
    cow, she's by where you got the book for Phlydia).  Talk to Dreppin (if you
    didn't talk to him before, you'll have to talk to him 3 times) and he'll
    take the potion from you, and you get 50 exp.
    Dreppin: Candlekeep (x 3264 y 430)

  - Killing Rats
    Talk to Reevor by the Storehouse, and he'll pester you to kill the rats in
    the storeroom.  Go inside and do just that.  Come back out and talk to
    Reevor again to get your reward, 5gp and 50 exp.
    Reevor: Candlekeep (x 4335 y 1454)

Assassination Attempts (it gets its own category...hehe): 2
  - Priest's Quarters (x 2961 y 437)
    Assassins: Shank -- Dagger, 20 exp
  - Bunkhouse (x 2055 y 2668)
    Assassins: Carbos -- Dagger, 20 exp
    Note: If you kill these assassins before they turn red and attack you, you
          get 2 exp.  Your reputation doesn't decrease either.

Other:
  - Star Sapphire
    In Winslows Inn, in Candlekeep, there is a Star Sapphire in a locked chest
    on the second floor.  A Halfling thief with maxed out Dexterity & maxed out
    Lockpicking skills will crack this lock, & you can then sell the sapphire
    to Winslow for 1000 gp. Very nice at the start of the game. Other thieves
    might be able to pull this off as well, though I haven't tried.  There's
    also some spells in a locked bookcase on the first floor, in the room
    behind Winslow. (from The Bruce)

    Tip: Don't want to be a halfling thief, but still want the gem? If you're
         playing in multi-player (see general strategies) you can create a
         second character -- yes, that same halfling thief with maxed DEX and
         maxed pick locks -- specifically for this purpose. Once he has the
         gem, you can drop him and keep the spoils.

  - Learn to Fight
    If you want to learn the battle system of Baldur's Gate in a controlled
    atmosphere, simply talk to the Gatewarden at (x 3065 y 3899) to set up a
    simulated combat experience.  You get no items from it, however, nor do you
    get any experience.

    Orlandu sent me this:
      "You actually do get SOME xp from fighting in the illusionist's place, if
      you are fighting monsters he hasn't conjured up yet, up to the
      hobgoblins.  It is just a tad hard to divide 1 xp to 6 people and get a
      whole number."

    edwardalacey sent me this:
      "During the prologue, there is an easy way to get some equipment for
      free.  Accept the Gatekeeper's offer of training in party combat (you
      have to have only one person in your party to be able to do this) and
      take all the temporary NPC's equipment (they have, among other things, a
      Small Shield +1 and a Wand of the Heavens). Yes, I know the items
      disappear if you leave, but if you export your character, start a new
      game, and then import him/her again, you get to keep them."

      Ed. Note:  However, if you DO do this trick, then do NOT go into this
                 area again!  When you are taken out of it, your items will
                 disappear!

    Rolf Zehb found a way to keep these NPC's:

      So I discovered, that those 5 npc in candlekeep (which are found together
      with "obe") could be taken outside of candlekeep without cheating.  How
      to get them:

        - have your training solved and before talking to obe the last time
          dismiss all of the npc in your group. while doing so stand near obe,
          so that you can talk to him. have the npc dismissed in a way, that
          they stand near you either.
        - then talk to the npc and if they want to join you answer "no".
        - now talk to obe and just before he teleports you outside - pause the
          game! (bit tricky but possible)
        - then (while the game is paused) talk to any npc.
        - then unpause.

      Sometimes when you are already teleported outside, a dialog-box appears
      and the npc ask you to join you!  If all goes right you have one npc
      still near obe!  Let this one talk to all the remaining npc.  Switch back
      to your main character and have him go instantly to gorion.  Talk to him
      and leave candlekeep.  The automatic scene with Sarevok starts.  If
      finished all the npc are still with you!

      Some of them are very interesting (one having the identification spell
      ready), one having lay-on-hands as special ability, one having
      invisibility and one having slow poision.  The dwarven fighter has a
      CON of 19 an he has even higher hitpoints than possible with a score of
      19.  The thief has extraordinary thiefish abilities!  The only lack is
      that none has a biography - but hey...

  - Learn to Fight part 2
    Another place to learn to fight is to talk to Jondalar (x 4094 y 1331).  He
    will attack you, you attack back.  Erik will sneak up behind you and shoot
    you with arrows.  Don't worry, they don't damage you.  You get nothing from
    this either.

  - Free Healing Potion
    Go to the healer's (x 3566 y 2932) and talk to the Priest of Oghma there,
    and tell him that you could use a little healing, and he will give you a
    potion of healing.

1a. Crossroads: Area E of Candlekeep & Area S of Friendly Arm Inn    [ATHCRS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  This is actually 2 areas in one since there isn't all that much to do
       here.  So, pay attention to where each subquest item is.

Companions:
  Note: I wouldn't bother with Xzar and Montanon here unless you are forming an
        all evil party.  One thing to do if you don't want to keep them, is to
        take them temporarily, steal everything they have of value, and then
        leave them. (they only really have a Studded Leather Armor, but Imoen
        could use that at this point!)  Another viewpoint would be to take and
        keep the duo until you find better people.
                 S  D  C  I  W  Ch
  - Imoen        9  18 16 17 11 16      Human        Thief         Neutral Good
    Imoen automatically will join you immediately after Gorion's death.  Unless
    you run away, that is.  Sometimes she comes with a Wand of Magic Missiles,
    now who did she steal that from?

  - Xzar         14 16 10 17 16 10      Human     Necromancer      Chaotic Evil
    Xzar and Montaron will join you on the crossroads right out of Candlekeep,
    and they want to go investigate the Nashkel mines (who doesn't).
    Where he is:  Crossroads (E of Candlekeep) (x 4577 y 2693)

  - Montaron     16 17 15 12 13 9      Halfling  Fighter/Thief     Neutral Evil
    Montaron is the dumb half of Montaron and Xzar, and goes where Xzar goes.
    Where he is:  Crossroads (E of Candlekeep) (x 4515 y 2707)

Enemies: Gibberlings, Xvarts, Bandits, Wolves, 1 Ogre (see subquests below)

Treasures:  Girdle of Masculinity/Feminity (An Ogre and His Belts)
            Girdle of Piercing (An Ogre and His Belts)

Plot:
  - You are now in the area where Gorion was killed, you need to go east, then
    north to get to the Friendly Arm Inn.

    Note: When you first enter the crossroads area, Elminster will talk to you.

    Strictly speaking, you don't have to go the Friendly Arm Inn at all. If you
    don't want Jaheira / Khalid, you can just head south to Beregost / Nashkel
    right away.

Subquests:
  - Chase and the Cliff
    Chase apparantly has nothing to live for, and is going to hurl himself off
    of a cliff.  You can talk him out of it, but it's not readily apparent what
    effect this has on the game.  No matter what you say to him, he doesn't
    jump.
    Chase: Area E of Candlekeep (x 1458 y 2412)


  - An Ogre and His Belts
    There is an ogre here who has a belt fetish.  Kill him and take the two
    belts.  The larger looking belt is the Girdle of Masculinity/Feminity
    (changes your sex) and the smaller one is the Girdle of Piercing + 3 vs.
    piercing.  You may want to wait to do this until you have more than 2
    people.  If you want, you can return the Girdle of Piercing to its owner,
    Unshey, in the Friendly Arm Inn (see that section below). I, however,
    never give it back. It is just too good against arrows.
    Ogre: Area S of Friendly Arm Inn (x 4787 y 1665)

Other:
  - Search Gorion's Body (area E of Candlekeep)
    You will find some treasure's around where Gorion was killed, including a
    letter that has some clue's about your origin. (x 3149 y 1373)

  - A Diamond (from Silviu)
    On the east side of the map is a stone path.  The path has three curves in
    it, one to the east and two to the west.  At the second curve to the west,
    the northern most curve, there are two trees standing on either side of the
    curve.  In the west tree, halfway up the treetrunk, a diamond can be found
    (worth 500 Gp.)
    Coordinates: Area E of Candlekeep (x 4418 y 1956)


  - A downed Caravan (area S of Friendly Arm Inn)
    You can check out a destroyed caravan, but there's only 7 gp there to be
    had.  (x 2348 y 3343)

  - Ring of Protection (from edwardalacey)
    On the map directly south of the Friendly Arm Inn there is a Ring of
    Protection +1, in a hole in a rock.
    Rock: Area S of Friendly Arm Inn (x 1006 y 1114)

2. Friendly Arm Inn (AR 2300)                                        [2FRNDL]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions:      S  D  C  I  W  Ch
  - Jaheira      15 14 17 10 14 15    Half-Elf   Fighter/Druid     True Neutral
    Jaheira and Khalid were good friends of Gorion, and will go with you every-
    where.  However, if you say "No" to them the first time they want to join,
    you won't be able to get them.  Ever.
    Where she is:  Friendly Arm Inn, Ground Floor (x 329 y 685)

  - Khalid       15 16 17 12 10 9      Half-Elf      Fighter       Neutral Good
    See Jaheira above for a description.
    Where he is:  Friendly Arm Inn, Ground Floor (x 329 y 685)

Enemies: Hobgoblins

Plot:
  - Beat the assassin, Tarnesh, to gain entrance to the Inn

  - Talk to Khalid and Jaheria and get them to join.  They tell you to go to
    Nashkel to the south to find out about this tainted ore thing. Don't worry,
    if you "forget" to go there, they will remind you. Again and again.

  - From here if you want a Paladin, go north and get Ajantis, otherwise head
    south to Nashkel.

Subquests:
  - Unshey's Belt
    If you want to part with the Girdle of Piercing (I would keep it), talk to
    Unshey in the Friendly Arm Inn to get a reward: History of Tethyr, 95gp,
    and 800 exp. If you give it away, you can kill him to get it back, but
    you will lose REP. You cannot pickpocket the belt.
    Unshey: Friendly Arm Inn, Second Floor (x 1190 y 753)

  - The Noble's Golden Pantaloons
    On the third floor of the Friendly Arm Inn you will find a nobleman who
    mistakes you for the laundry service of the inn, and he gives you his
    Golden Pantaloons for washing.  You can't do anything with the pantaloons
    so give them back to the Noble for 100 exp.  Not bad for not doing a thing.

    On the other hand, if you keep the pantaloons ("always keep the
    pantaloons") there is some payoff if you import your character into
    Baldur's Gate II.
    Noble: Friendly Arm Inn, Third Floor (x 336 y 673)

  - Landrin's Spiders
    Landrin's house in Beregost has been overrun by spiders, and that is why
    she is hiding in the Friendly Arm Inn. Someone should tell her about the
    Jovial Juggler Inn, it's right next door to her house! She gives you a
    bunch of antidotes and promises a reward if you bring back the body of the
    spider, her husband's boots, and some wine.  Go to Beregost, and into the
    house by the Jovial Juggler.  Kill the spiders, loot one spider for its
    body, then search the house for the wine and boots. Take the 3 items and
    return to Landrin for your reward: for the boots (300 exp, 120gp), for the
    Spider Body (200 exp, 100gp), and for the wine (300 exp, 75gp). You have to
    turn each item in separately.
    Landrin: Friendly Arm Inn, Third Floor (x 796 y 735)
    Spiders: Beregost (x 3078 y 3416)

  - Joia's Flamedance Ring
    Hobgoblins north of the Inn have swiped Joia's flamedance ring.  Kill them
    to get it back.  Joia is in the house just to the west of the outer gate in
    the inner grounds.  She won't give you anything, but you get 400 exp and
    Rep + 1.
    Hobgoblins: Friendly Arm Inn (x 2554 y 292)
    Joia: Friendly Arm Inn (x 1536 y 2484)

  - Ring of Wizardry (from edwardalacey)
    When you arrive outside the Friendly Arm Inn, walk along the bottom of the
    map, to the east. You find a large tree with a slightly darker patch on the
    ground nearby, at x=2555, y=3759. If you move the mouse over it you will
    find that it is a container and contains the Ring of Wizardry
    (x2 Level 1 spells).  This is hard to find but it is there.  I've heard
    that Tales of the Sword Coast removed it, but that the TotSC patch put it
    back in.
    Ring:  Friendly Arm Inn (x 2555 y 3759)

Assassination Attempts: 1
  - Steps to the Entrance (x 3364 y 2252)
    Tarnesh -- 120 exp, 58gp and 3 spells

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first enter Beregost, in addition to having to watch a little
      movie (which is on Disc 2), you also get some directions from Golin Vend.

Companions:      S  D  C  I  W  Ch
  - Kagain       16 12 20 15 11 8       Dwarf       Fighter         Lawful Evil
    Kagain runs a Mercenary business, and one of his caravans has disappeared.
    Help him recover it, and you get to keep what you find.  Goodie.  Take him
    to the Area S of the Friendly Arm Inn and he will get disgusted with
    looking for Caravans, but will still stay in your party.
    Where he is:  Beregost (Shop North of Feldepost Inn) (x 1549 y 2031)

  - Garrick      14 16 9  13 14 15      Human         Bard      Chaotic Neutral
    Garrick will join you only after you finish the Silke subquest (see below).
    Where he is:  Beregost, by the Burning Wizard Inn (x 2564 y 2284)

Enemies: none

Treasures:  Ring of Protection +1 (Mirianne's Letter)
            Medium Shield +1 (Bjornin's Half-Ogres)
            Staff +1 (Silke)
            Algernon's Cloak (Algernon's Cloak)
            Ankheg Armor (Ankheg Armor)

Plot:
  - We're just passing through Beregost on our way to Nashkel in the south, but
    there are a great many subquests here to do, and I would suggest doing all
    that you feel you can.

Subquests:
  - Mirianne's Letter
    Just south of Beregost you will find two Ogrillons, and on one of their
    bodies is a letter for a Mirianne, who lives in Beregost.  Take her the
    letter and she will give you a Ring of Protection + 1 and 300 exp.
    Mirianne: Beregost (x 4804 y 2086)
    Ogrillons: Area S of Beregost (x 3850 y 1460)

  - Firebead Elvenhair's Book
    You'll find Firebead in Beregost (he was also in Candlekeep while you were
    there) and he wants you to pick a book up for him, the History of the
    Fateful Coin.  You can find it across the street in the Feldepost's Inn
    (for 2gp).  Give him the book and you get 300 exp, the History of the Dead
    Three, and a Reputation + 1. (If he doesn't give you the subquest, you can
    still complete it, just buy the book and give it to him as if he had)

      Note: If you're cheap, the book History of the Fateful Coin can be found
            in a bookcase in the home directly south of Firebeard's place.
            (from John Van De Graaf)

      Josh Clue sent in this exploit:
        "Forgot to mention this one in the last e-mail. Even if you do kill
        Firebead in Candlekeep, he manages to pull himself out of the grave
        and back into his house in Beregost... Yep, we can put him down for
        good for another 2700 XP! You can use the same ranged weapon technique
        you used in Candlekeep if your level is still low."

    Firebead: Beregost (x 2044 y 2905)
    Feledepost's Inn: Beregost (x 1406 y 2640)

  - Marl the Drunk
    Marl is in the Feldepost Inn, and he has had his fill of adventurers.  He
    accosts you in the bar, and you can fight him (650 exp), but you can also
    talk him out of fighting.  Choose options 1, 1, 3, 3, 1.  For your trouble
    you get 900 exp.  Interestingly enough, if you choose to kill him you do
    not get a decrease in reputation.  (which leads to this oddity found by
    edwardalacey:  After calming Marl down, you can kill him to get that
    experience as well, with no loss of reputation!)
    Marl: Beregost, Feledepost's Inn (x 1406 y 2640)

  - Kagain's Quest
    Kagain lost a caravan that he was protecting, and a noble's son was
    kidnapped by bandits.  Agree to help him get the kid back, and he will join
    with you.
    Kagain: Beregost (x 1516 y 2030)

  - Landrin's Spiders Part 2
    We first heard of this quest back in the Friendly Arm Inn, and now we can
    finally complete it.  Go to Landrin's house, it is the one just to the left
    of the Jovial Juggler Inn.  Inside will be several spiders.  Kill them, and
    one will leave behind a spider body for you to take.  Also take the Worn
    Out Boots and the Wine in the chest by the bed.  (you don't want to use
    either, since we are returning them to Landrin back in the Friendly Arm
    Inn)  Take the items back to Landrin for your reward: for the boots (300
    exp, 120gp), for the Spider Body (200 exp, 100gp), and for the wine (300
    exp, 75gp).
    Landrin: Friendly Arm Inn, Third Floor (x 796 y 735)
    Spiders: Beregost (x 3078 y 3416)

  - Gurke's Cloak
    The Dwarf Gurke, whom you can find in the Jovial Juggler Inn, has had his
    cloak stolen from him by some Tasloi in the Cloakwood Forest.  You will
    find it semi-hidden under a tree.  Take it and return to Gurke, who doesn't
    actually want it anymore to get your reward: 300 exp, and you get to keep
    the Cloak of Non-Detection.
    Gurke: Beregost (x 3760 y 3627)
    Cloak: Cloakwood Forest One (x 4391 y 3472)

  - Bjornin's Half-Ogres
    The Paladin Bjornin, who is recuperating in the Jovial Juggler Inn, was
    beaten by some nasty Half-Ogres south south-west of Beregost.  (Go south
    twice, then west once)  Go there and defeat all the Half-Ogres that you can
    find, then return to Bjornin to get your reward:  Medium Shield +1, 400
    exp, Reputation +1
    Bjornin: Beregost (x 3760 y 3627)
    Half-Ogres: Area S-SW of Beregost

  - Silke
    If you talk to Garrick, who is in front of the Burning Wizard Inn, he asks
    for your help in defending the Lady Silke.  Agree to his proposal, and
    follow him to Silke.  Talk to Silke, if she likes the look of you she will
    offer to pay more than what Garrick offered (I got 400 offered).  The
    "thugs" will show up, but act like Silke had hired them for some purpose,
    and now she had double crossed them.  Refuse to kill them and instead kill
    Silke (900 exp, 400gp, Staff +1, Potion).

    Tip: You can pickpocket each of the 3 men for potions of defense. Do this
         before talking to them. If you don't have enough pickpocket to get
         the potions, they will stay there as long as you don't talk to them.
         (from Yamian)

    Talk to one of the men who Silke was going to kill to get a Potion of
    Defense.  Lastly, if you want, you can get Garrick to join your party.

    If you do what Silke asks and kill the three men, you get 400 gp, lose
    2 reputation points, and can't get Garrick to join you.  Then, of course,
    you could just kill Silke afterwards...

    Garrick: Beregost (x 2498 y 2267)
    Silke: Beregost (x 3455 y 2143)

  - Zhurlong's Boots
    In the Burning Wizard Inn you will find a "pesky" thief named Zhurlong.  He
    was going about his business (stealing from people like you) and had his
    Boots of Stealth stolen by some Hobgoblins.  You can find these Hobgoblins
    to the south of Beregost.  Oh, and did I mention that he swipes gold from
    you everytime you talk to him?  Return the boots to get your gold back, and
    to get a reward: 300 exp, 100gp (plus whatever he stole from you).  Or you
    could keep the boots, they are Boots of Stealth (stealth +35%).  Or you
    could give him the boots, then kill him and take the boots back, suffering
    no loss in reputation.
    Zhurlong: Beregost (x 2649 y 2030)
    Hobgoblins: Area S of Beregost (x 1865 y 2449)

  - Perdue's Short Sword (from Operador de Sala and edwardalacey)
    You can find Perdue in the Red Sheaf Inn.  A Gnoll has stolen his short
    sword in High Hedge.  Be careful when you talk to Perdue, because you can
    easily lose this subquest.  He tells you about a Dog Face and you have to
    say to him if the Dog Face is a Gnoll.  Give the sword to Perdue for your
    reward: 50 gp and 500 exp.

    The correct conversation thread is 1,2,1,1.

    Perdue: Red Sheaf Inn (Beregost) (x 3273 y 2124)
    Gnoll: High Hedge (W of Beregost) (x 3780 y 2818)

Assassination Attempts: 1
  - Inside the Red Sheaf Inn (x 3273 y 2124)
    Karlat -- 270 exp, Chain Mail, Shield, 38 gp

Other:
  - Robbing Houses
    There are a great many houses in Beregost that you can rob.  I would send
    in only your thief, and once inside, immediately save it.  Then rob the
    house.  If any of the chests are locked, try to pick it first, then bash
    it.  If you get caught, re-load and try again.  If you don't get caught,
    your reputation can't go down!

  - Algernon's Cloak
    In the Feldepost's Inn on the second floor you will find a fat man named
    Algernon.  Pick his pocket to steal his wonderful cloak. (save it before
    you do this, as if it fails, he will attack and you lose reputation)  So
    what is so special about the Cloak?  Well it has the obvious effect of +2
    Charisma.  But if you use it as an item (click on the backpack icon) you
    can charm people/animals/monsters.  Cool.
    Feledepost's Inn: Beregost (x 1406 y 2640)

  - Oogie Wisham's fear of Paladins
    On the second floor of the Jovial Juggler you will find Oogie Wisham, who
    has a dreadful fear of the Paladin Bjornin.  Nothing you say will fix his
    irrational fear.

  - Ankheg Armor
    If you have an Ankheg Shell you can either sell it for 500gp, or you can
    turn it into a very nice armor (AC 1) for 4000gp.  Talk to Taerom in the
    Smithy about it and try to get the armor made (it's the first option in
    your dialogue).  If you have 4000gp good, but if not, you can always go
    hunt down Bassilus for the money.  See the 3b. Area SW of Beregost section
    for the Bassilus subquest.  It will take him about 10 days or so to make
    the armor.
    Smithy: Beregost (x 4615 y 2828)

  - Kivan     18/12 17 14 10 14 8        Elf        Ranger         Chaotic Good
    Kivan wants to hunt some bandits.  If you kick him out of the party, he
    stays gone for good!
    Where he is:  High Hedge (x 3652 y 1472)

Enemies: Skeletons, Gnolls, Gnoll Slashers, Flinds, Ghasts

Plot:
  - We've come to High Hedge for a few reasons, to pick up the Ranger Kivan,
    who makes a good addition to a good aligned party, and to enter High Hedge
    to talk to the Wizard Thalantyr there.  He sells many great and wonderful
    things, magical items, and spells!  You will have to talk to him twice to
    get him to talk to you.  Also be wary of his Flesh Golems!

Subquests:
  - Perdue's Short Sword
    Gnoll: High Hedge (W of Beregost) (x 3780 y 2818)

Other:
  - At the entrance to High Hedge you will find a burgler named Permidion
    Stark.  He is planning the Greatest Heist of all time, robbing the High
    Hedge.  Of course, he gets scared and runs off.  It would seem that there
    are Flesh Golems inside, and that they are too much for him.

  - There is an Aquamarine Gem (value 75gp) in a house at (x 1757 y 1526)

3b. Area SW of Beregost (South of High Hedge)                        [BRSWFB]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Wolves, Skeletons, Ghasts, Hobgoblins, Hobgoblin Elites

Treasues:  War Hammer +2 (The Dark Cleric Bassilus)

Plot:
  - We're here mainly to kill Bassilus and then to take his holy symbol to the
    Temple East of Beregost for the 5000gp reward!

Subquests:
  - Melicamp the Chicken
    In the North East of this area you will find a talking chicken being
    attacked by a wolf.  Kill the wolf and talk to the chicken.  Turns out he
    is Melicamp the Mage, and he appears to have polymorphed himself into the
    form of a chicken, but now can't reverse it.  You can try to dispel it, but
    if you fail, then he asks you to take him up to High Hedge where Thalantyr
    can reverse it.  When you are back in the High Hedge area, find a skeleton
    and kill it (they're around), and take its skull.  You'll need it.  Go
    inside and talk to Thalantyr.  Once he is done talking, and has told you to
    go get a Skull, talk to him again. (I would save it before doing so,
    however)  Thalantyr will cast "antichickenator" and there is a 50% random
    chance that it will work. (which is why we saved it!  If it didn't work,
    simply reload)  Reward: 2000 exp, and a reputation +1
    Melicamp: Area SW of Beregost (x 4543 y 407)
    Thalantyr: High Hedge (x 2922 y 2619)

  - The Dark Cleric Bassilus
    As you may know from Beregost, Bassilus has a bounty on his head the size
    of 5000gp.  Bassilus is located to the south and east of the area, and
    getting there you may encounter Footy from Beregost, who was looking at
    Bassilus' "spooks".  Go near him, and talk to him, he will mistake you for
    a long lost parent (depending on your gender, mother or father).  In order
    say this, 3, 1, 1.  He will get angry and lose control of his skeletons and
    zombies (they all fall down, dead once more).  All you have to do now is to
    defeat him! (exp 975)  Take at least his Holy Symbol (you will probably
    also want that War Hammer +2, leave the Gauntlets where they are--they're
    cursed) and go to the Temple East of Beregost.  Talk there to Keldath
    Ormlyr to get your reward: 5000gp, 1000 exp
    Bassilus: Area SW of Beregost (x 4229 y 2797)
    Keldath Ormlyr: Temple E of Beregost (x 1233 y 1064)

Other:
  - Zargal the Hobgoblin
    You may encounter Zargal near the center of the Area.  He wants all your
    money.  If you don't give it to him, expect a fight.  He gives 650 exp, and
    his 2 cronies each give 165, so not bad.  Plus they have a Short Sword +2.
    Zargal: Area SW of Beregost (x 2886 y 2457)

Enemies: Half-Ogres, Skeletons, Gnolls, Hobgoblins, Ogres, Flinds

Plot:
  - We're here to finish the Half-Ogre killing quest that Bjornin requested.

Subquests:
  - Bjornin's Half-Ogres (see the Beregost section above)

  - Help Drizzt Do'Urden
    Somewhere near the center of the map you will find Drizzt being attacked by
    some Gnolls.  He will ask for your help in defeating the Gnolls.  Agree and
    attack them.  Once the Gnolls are slaughtered, you can talk to Drizzt (of
    if you prefer, you could try to pick his pocket, although if he catches
    you...) and tell him about how things are in this area.  He will tell you
    to try to join up with the bandits in order to defeat them.
    Drizzt: Area S-SW of Beregost (x 2644 y 2107)

  - Kill Drizzt Do'Urden
    Alternatively, you could kill Drizzt and take his neato items. Despite what
    you may think, his armor is just standard enchanted chain mail. So no, you
    can't case arcane spells while wearing it.

    KyleEChu sent me this:

      "Here's a tip I use all the time: The Best Way to Kill Drizzt!
      The best time to do this is when your reputation is 14.  Killing Drizzt
      will incur the same penalty as killing an innocent.  At 14, you only lose
      5 points.  Equip your entire party with projectile weapons, and stock up
      on ammunition.  Have everyone carry as much ammunition as they can.  Ask
      a sacrificial NPC to join.  Garrick or Edwin are good for this purpose.
      Now go to the area where Drizzt is (S-SW of Beregost) and position your
      main party on the south edge of the small island in the middle of the
      lake.  The south shore of the lake should just be visible to them.
      Select your sacrificial NPC and approach Drizzt.  When he tries to talk
      to you, lure him to the south shore of the lake so that your main party
      can see him.  Threaten Drizzt and he will attack, and most likely smash
      your sacrificial NPC into pieces.  He will not be able to reach the rest
      of your party.  Select your main party and let him have it!  Because you
      are low-level and he has a high AC, you need to practically rely on
      critical hits to damage him.  After you knock off his 96 HP, he finally
      falls and you can go get his stuff."

    edwardalacey had this to add:

      "KyleEChu's method for killing Drizzt is very clever, but here is a piece
      of advice which might help if anybody has trouble with it.  When I tried
      it I found that Drizzt came around the lake and killed me.  The solution
      turned out to be my "path search nodes" setting.  It was 32000, which was
      enough for the program to find a path around the lake, but when I turned
      it down temporarily to the minimum 2000 using the configuration program
      he could not get round and I could kill him."

      Editor's Note:  You change your "path search nodes" setting in the
                      Baldur.ini file in the Baldur's Gate directory (which
                      should be something like
                        C:\program files\black isle\baldur's gate\).
                      If you can't find it in the baldur.ini, you can add it
                      under [Program Options]
                      Path Search Nodes=2000

    Juha Alm has another way to take out Drizzt:

      Killing Drizzt: I know a way to kill Drizzt with no one getting hurt.
      First have Drizzt stop walking by clicking on him as you would talk to
      him. But don't talk, stop and let 4 of your NPC's walk next to him so he
      cant move. Now go stand next to one of them. Remove the NPC from your
      party, and because you're standing right next to him/her, he wont walk
      towards you, only starts speaking. Now do this to the other 3 NPC's.
      After done you'll have Drizzt trapped in the middle of 4 characters, and
      he wont attack them because they are not in your party, and they are
      civilians. Now just fire with magical arrows or take a long weapon
      (spear, staff or halberd) and go stand behind one of your NPC's. You can
      hit over him/her, and Drizzt can't hit you back because he can't reach
      you with his scimitars. And when you kill him with only 1 or 2
      characters in your party, the main character gains all of the 12000 (1
      char) or "only" 6000 exp. with 2 characters on party.

    his name is Noober.  If you manage to put up with him long enough, he will
    eventually "run out of things to say" and wander off.  (after you get a
    small reward of 400 exp)  Personally I'm not usually that patient, and cast
    Polymorph Other on him to let him live the rest of his life as a squirrel.
    Such tough choices we have in life.  This one is easier to do if you talk
    to him instead of making him talk to you.

  - Daer'Ragh isn't quite dead
    Go look in the cemetery for the grave of "Mark D" and you will find that
    its occupant isn't quite as dead as he pretends to be.  If you keep
    bothering the grave, he will summon a host of Phoenix Guards to kill you.
    When you kill a Phoenix Guard, they immediately return, but if you kill
    them again, they explode in a fireball.  Nasty.  If you are going to do
    this, make sure that everyone in your party has a Protection from Fire on
    them. He has nothing, and isn't worth much xp, so, it isn't really worth
    trying.
    Grave: Nashkel (x 2926 y 1285)

    John Lucas has an interesting trick here:

      If someone is wearing a Ring of Fire Resistance, and you cast the cleric
      spell Protection from Fire on them, their fire resistance is now over
      100% and they recover hit points from fire attacks.  I think the ring
      gives 50% protection and the spell gives 80% which adds up to 130% and
      fire attacks display the message Character Name:  Damage Taken (-5),
      meaning you've recovered 5 hit points, or however many.

      I'm still playing through the game, but the best use of this I've found
      so far is in Nashkel with the Phoenix Guards, Oublek and some Amnish
      soldiers.  After the subquest with the artist formerly known as Prism and
      Greywolf, you've got a choice of how to handle the return of the gems and
      receiving your reward.  You can give both gems to Oublek at the same
      time, then kill him to get 4 gems (instead of 2) and about 3000 gp.
      Note, one of the sections lacking from your faq is about Pick Pocketing
      and all the good stuff you can get that way, but in this case, you can't
      pick pocket the gems away from Oublek, but you can get the Phoenix Guards
      to kill him for you (and hopefully some Amnish soldiers, too).

      Just give the ring of fire resistance to a good fighter and cast
      Protection from Fire (not the 1st level resist fire/cold).  Make sure his
      AC is as beefy as you can get it, and give him a good weapon like
      Drizzt's +5 scimitar (+3 to hit and +2 to AC).  Send all other party
      members into a nearby building and click on the "Mark D" grave to summon
      Daer'Ragh and the Phoenix Guards.  Just stand beside Oublek and whack one
      until he blows up.  Oublek's dead.  If there are any Amnish soldiers
      around, they'll start attacking the PG.  Move closer to the soldiers and
      when a PG blow's, it'll kill the soldier and you can collect all his cool
      stuff.  Each soldier has armor, sword and bow you can sell, the coolest
      non-magical helmet in the game (my character always wears one now),
      over-sized arrow stacks (up to 30) and, on at least one occasion, one of
      them had a spell scroll.

      The beauty of all this is that if the PG are doing any damage to you at
      all with their weapons (they are actually pretty wimpy except for the
      exploding fireball death), the fireballs will be healing you.  The
      Protection from Fire spell lasts a good while, so you could wander up and
      down the street with 3 or 4 PG following you, looking for more Amnish
      soldiers if you wanted to.

      As a side note, whenever a PG dies and explodes around other PG, the
      living ones are also healed by the fireball. That is, each one gets
      negative damage.

  - Winter Wolf Pelts (from Operador de Sala)
    In the Nashkell store you can sell the wolf winter shells for 500 gp, the

    pelts that he will buy.

    Petrification enchantment that was placed on her by the Mage Tranzig.  Free
    her using a Stone to Flesh spell (you can buy them in Nashkel for 168gp or

    It would seem that Zordral is convinced that Bentha is a witch, and is
    about to kill her, when you enter the tent.  You can't really talk him out
    of it, so say options 1, then 1 again.  He will get violent and attack you.
    Kill him (900 exp, 2 spells, Knaves Robe, 79gp), and then talk to Bentha.
    If you ask for a "trinket" she will give you an Antidote, if you ask for
    information she tells you that Volo is staying in the Nashkel Inn.  And if
    you say that the deed was its own reward, she gives you the Antidote
    anyway.

  - Vitiare the Thief
    In a tent you will be robbed of 100 gp by Vitiare the Thief.  Easiest way
    to avoid this is to not go into the tent!  Although since it is a thief,
    you could steal from him (payback time).  But for that, you'll have to kill
    him.  First, save your game.  Equip all of your characters with ranged
    weapons then, enter the tent and immediately, pause the game.  Now tell one
    of your fighters to go speak to him and unpause.  If you did this right,
    Vitiare won't move and will wait for your fighter to get near to initiate
    the conversation.  Once he steals 100 gp from you and tries to get away,
    force-attack him with all of your party members.  You have to be quick and
    kill him before he gets to the exit of the tent or he'll be gone forever.
    If he gets away, reload and try again.  Killing him gives you: 12 xp, a
    Dagger, 1 Healing Potion, 1 Potion of Master Thievery, 1 Potion of Agility
    and 173 gp.  Don't worry, you won't lose any reputation points for killing
    him.
    Vitiare:  Carnival (x 1555 y 2928)

  - The Merchants Two Potions
    In one of the tents you will find a Merchant who sells "Wonders".  But due
    to the Iron Shortage, all he can sell are two potions, each for 50gp.  One
    is a Titan's Might potion which sets your Strength to 25, but takes your
    Constitution and Dexterity down to 3.  The other makes you smart as
    Elminster (Int 25), but takes Strength and Wisdom down to 3.  Each potion
    lasts about 24 hours.  So use caution before using one of these!
    Personally, I suggest you sell them for 250 gp each (easy money for low
    level characters at the start of the adventure).
    Merchant: Carnival (x 1865 y 3518)

  - The Great Gazib and The Amazing Oopah
    The Great Gazib puts on quite a show each time you speak to him by making
    his Ogre friend (Oopah) explode. Of course, on the third time, Oopah is
    angry of exploding for puny pink weaklings and wants to smash their faces.
    So be ready to fight Oopah the third time you speak to The Great Gazib.
    Your reward: 270 xp for killing Oopah.

4c. Area N of Gnollish Stronghold                                    [CRNFGN]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Ogre Berserkers, Hobgoblins, Gibberlings, Wild Dogs, Ogrillons, Ogres

  Note: There are 2 bridges across the stream here, the southern bridge is
        covered in the subquest "Jared and the Mountain Bear." The northern
        bridge is guarded by Ogre Berserkers and Hobgoblin archers. It is a
        much harder fight than you would think as they shoot poison arrows,
        and the Ogre blocks your path on the bridge, so they can hide behind
        him and shoot you freely. If you don't have a good set of ranged
        attacks, I would skip it.

Treasures:  Long Sword +1 (Neville the Bandit)
            Boots of the North (Jared and the Mountain Bear)

Plot:
  - We're just passing through here going to the Gnoll Fortress to the South.

Subquests:
  - Neville the Bandit
    How you talk to Neville completely changes the outcome.  If you ask that
    his men come out of hiding, he attacks you. (he is worth about 650 exp and
    has a Long Sword +1 too)  If you ask for all his gold, he steals some of
    yours (but you get 100 exp from that action).
    Neville: Area N of Gnollish Stronghold (x 3796 y 852)

  - Jared and the Mountain Bear
    The nobleman Jared is deathly afraid of a Bear on the other side of the
    south bridge here.  Go across and kill the bear.  Then return to Jared to
    get your reward: Boots of the North, 150 exp. If you don't get the boots,
    your CHA is too low.
    Jared: Area N of Gnollish Stronghold (x 4673 y 3665)
    Bear: Area N of Gnollish Stronghold (x 3215 y 3494)

Other:
  - The Eating Ogre
    There is an ogre by a fire who is not interested in fighting, all he seems
    to want to do is munch.  Talk to him twice to get him to fight you.
    Ogre: Area N of Gnollish Stronghold (x 415 y 920)

  - Laurel and the Gibberlings (from Operador de Sala)
    Laurel wants your help to kill some of these creatures, because they aren't
    good.  Then a Gibberlings band comes, kill all the Gibberlings you can see
    (Laurel will attack them, too).  When there are no more creatures talk
    again with Laurel for your reward: 250 exp.

4d. Gnollish Stronghold (AR 5100)                                    [DGNLLS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first visit the Gnollish Stronghold you get to watch a little
      movie (on Disc 3) which reveals where the Gnolls put their prisoners, and
      what happens to those prisoners as well.  Also note that most the enemies
      in the fort are constantly re-spawning, so even when you just kill a
      group of gnolls they could almost immediately come back.

Companions:      S  D  C  I  W  Ch
  - Dynaheir     11 13 16 17 15 12      Human       Invoker         Lawful Good
    Dynaheir was kidnapped by the Gnolls, and must be rescued with Minsc in
    your party.  She is also linked to Minsc and if one leaves, the other does
    too.  She makes a good mage because she already knows such spells as
    Fireball. (depends on the level you get her at)
    Where she is:  Gnollish Stronghold (x 2529 y 1440)

Enemies: Gnolls, Half-Ogres, Xvarts, Carrion Crawlers, Gnoll Slashers, Gnoll
         Veterans, Gnoll Chieftan

Treasures:  Gauntlets of Dexterity (Gnarl, Hairtooth, and the Gauntlets of Dex)
            The Tome of Leadership and Influence (Charisma +1)

Plot:
  - There is only really one reason to come here, and that is Dynaheir.  If you
    are coming with Minsc you are coming to rescue her, if you are coming with
    Edwin you are coming to kill her.

  - From the bridge go straight west. (the southern path leads to two Xvart
    caves, and the Tome, see Other below) Head up the stairs at (x 1462 y 1326),
    and then go east to the pit at (x 2472 y 1265).  Go down into the pit to
    find Dynaheir.

  - All you have to do now is to get out alive!

Subquests:
  - Gnarl, Hairtooth, and the Gauntlets of Dexterity
    Across the bridge are a couple of Half-Ogre guards named Gnarl and
    Hairtooth and they want you to pay for the privelege of crossing their
    bridge.  At first they want 200 gold, but you can haggle down to 100.  Or
    you could just kill them.  Each are worth 175 exp.  Plus on one of the
    bodies you will find the Gauntlets of Dexterity!  (they set someone's
    dexterity to 18, which will be a step up for most people, or a step down if
    you are above 18)
    Gnarl: Gnollish Stronghold (x 3814 y 2850)

Other:
  - The Tome of Leadership and Influence (Charisma +1)
    Just west of the bridge is a southern path which leads around the cliffside
    to a set of two caves.  In the eastern of the two caves are some healing
    potions, spells, and the Tome of Leadership and Influence.

Companions: none

Enemies: Winter Wolves, Gnolls, Cave Bears, Wolves, Xvarts, Dread Wolves,
         Dire Wolves, Flinds, Gnoll Elites

Treasures:  Girdle of Bluntness (The Dryad and the Oak)
            Halberd +1 (Dire Wolf Cave)

Plot:
  - Nothing but a few subquests to do here.  Also you can sell the Winter Wolf
    pelts back in Nashkel for 500 gp.

Subquests:
  - The Dryad and the Oak
    The Dryad of Cloudpeak needs your help to save a "wondrous ancient oak"
    from some villainy.  Agree to help her, and then go a little to the SW to
    find the tree and the two villains, Krumm and Caldo.  Talk to the north
    one, Caldo, and tell them that they'll have to go through you first.  Kill
    them.  Krumm (the south one) has a Girdle of Bluntness.  Talk to the Dryad
    again to get your reward: Aura Cleansed (whatever that does), an Antidote,
    500 exp, and a Reputation +1.
    Dryad: Area SW of Nashkel (x 3591 y 1894)
    2 villains: Area SW of Nashkel (x 3350 y 2065)

  - Drienne's Cat
    Just to the East of the waterfall you will find the girl Drienne crying
    about her lost cat.  Seems the cat fell into the waterfall and Drienne
    can't find her.  Go down and search the waterfall for the cat's body, and
    then return it to Drienne.  Turns out that this isn't the first time that
    the cat has died, and been raised from the dead by her necromancer father!
    As a reward you get:  200 exp, Reputation +1, and a Scroll (Protection from
    Undead).
    Drienne: Area SW of Nashkel (x 2084 y 2959)
    Cat: Area SW of Nashkel (x 1760 y 3318)

Other:
  - Ingot the Gnoll
    Seems the Gnoll Ingot wanted to roast Dynaheir alive, while the rest of the
    Gnolls did not, and so he was banished.
    Ingot: Area SW of Nashkel (x 553 y 1185)

  - Gnoll Territory
    The Gnolls in the north of the area will demand 50 gold because you have
    trespassed in their territory.  You can pay if you want.  They have better
    than average treasures for Gnolls, but nothing great.
    Gnolls: Area SW of Nashkel (x 3184 y 719)

  - Dire Wolf Cave
    Near the Oak Tree (see the Dryad and the Oak subquest above) is a cave.
    Inside you will find a single Dire Wolf and a treasure box.  Inside that
    box is a Halberd +1, 298gp, and a Tiger Cowrie Shell Necklace.
    Cave: Area SW of Nashkel (x 3141 y 2600)

Companions: none

Enemies: Xvarts, Skeletons, Cave Bears

Treasures:  Long Sword +1 (Sendai of Amn)
            Studded Leather +2 (Sendai of Amn)
            Bracers of Archery (Vax and Zal, the Fastest Dart Thrower in West)

Plot:
  - Just one subquests here, and some other odd things (like the Bracers of
    Archery, see the Vax and Zal "other" below)

Subquests:
  - Albert's Dog Rufie
    Albert from Nashkel has lost his dog, and it is up to you to find him.
    Agree to help Albert and he will give you a chew toy to "entice" Rufie
    with.  You will find Rufie a ways to the east (he looks like a red wolf).
    When you have found him, he should follow you, now head back to Albert with
    the dog (or wolf) in tow.  Albert will turn into a demon (or something) and
    take the dog with him back to hell, for your trouble you get: 1000 exp.

    Alternatively:  Kill Ruffie, then talk to Albert to get 1200 experience.

    Albert: Area S of Nashkel (x 1315 y 999)
    Rufie: Area S of Nashkel (x 3753 y 751)

Other:
  - Larry and his two brothers (Darryl and Darryl)
    In the SE of the Area you will find 3 creatures, an Xvart, a Kobold, and a
    Tasloi.  They are named, Larry, Darryl and Darryl.  Talk to Larry (the
    Kobold) and if you ask why they are there they wander off saying that you
    are the "wrong generation".  Or you could ask for their autograph, and they
    will give it to you!  If you don't get this joke, you probably never saw
    the Bob Newhart Show.
    Larry, Darryl, and Darryl: Area S of Nashkel (x 4213 y 3452)

  - Sendai of Amn
    Sendai is a prickly sort, and she happens to have a very low opinion of
    everyone from the north of Amn.  Depending on how you answer her you will
    either end up in a fight, or she'll just wander off.  She has a lot of good
    treasures on her, plus is worth a bit of experience, but CAUTION she has
    two companions with bows and magic arrows!  So if you fight them, quickly
    move your fighters up to the archers to take out their effectiveness.
    (Alexander--300 exp, Scale, Hemlet, 29gp, Healing Potion, Long Bow, 30
    Arrows +1; Sendai--600 exp, Long Sword +1, Studded Leather +2, Helmet,
    Small Shield, 172gp; Delgod--300 exp, Scale, 30 Arrows +1, Long Bow, War
    Hammer)
    Sendai: Area S of Nashkel (x 3103 y 887)

  - Vax and Zal (the fastest Dart Thrower in the West)
    Once you have encountered these two, you've seen just about everything.
    Vax will come up to you and demand all your money, on account that Zal
    could throw darts at you really fast.  If you don't want to part with your
    money you'll have to fight them.  (Zal--600 exp, Scale, Bracers of Archery,
    Darts, 49gp; Vax--400 exp, Scale, 2 Heal Potions, Halberd, 107gp)
    Vax and Zal: Area S of Nashkel (x 1270 y 2627)

  - Blurry Ledge (edwardalacey)
    In the area south of Nashkel (where you get the Bracers of Archery), there
    is what looks like a rather blurry ledge.  In it is Chromatic Orb and the
    hard-to-find Cloudkill.

5. The Nashkel Mines (Exterior)                                      [5NSHKL]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Wolves, Winter Wolves, Kobolds, War Dogs, Ghasts

Treasures:  Long Sword +2 (Prism's Final Masterpiece)
            Wand of Frost (Wand of Frost)

Plot:
  - We're here to investigate the strange goings-on in the Mines.  To enter the
    mines talk to Emerson at (x 978 y 1125).  Then talk to one of the Amnish
    soldiers guarding the mines to get rid of two of them, and finally you
    enter the mine (x 1202 y 665).

Subquests:
  - Prism's Final Masterpiece
    You will finally find Prism working on his last piece here.  He had to
    steal some of the materials to make this, and so has the bounty hunter
    Greywolf after him.  Tell him that you are not associated with Greywolf,
    and agree to help defend him so that he can complete his work.  Not long
    after that Greywolf will show up, and will demand that you hand Prism over
    to him.  Don't.  He'll attack you then, beat him (1400 exp, Studded
    Leather, Long Sword +2, 102gp).  Prism finished his work, but doesn't live
    long to enjoy it.  You get: 1000 exp, and Reputation +1.  Search his body
    for 3gp and 2 Emeralds.

    edwardalacey sent me this:

      "After dealing with Greywolf and Prism, you can take Prism's emeralds to
      Oublek for a reward of 200 experience and 300 gold. Interestingly, you
      can drop one on the ground, claim the reward, pick it up, and claim the
      reward again."

      Editor's Note:  Or you could claim the reward once, and sell the other
                      Emerald for 750 gp.

    Terry deBoer has a different approach to this:

      After getting the emeralds from Prism, take them to Oublek and give him
      both at once.  After that, just kill him and he will not only have the
      two on his person, but another two have appeared as well!  Selling all
      four, plus the 2000+ gold Oublek carries gets you over 5000 gold, more
      than enough to bribe your rep back up.  It's risky though; it's best to
      charm him and lead him away, or the whole town will see your act.

  - Xan          13 16 7  17 14 16       Elf       Enchanter     Lawful Neutral
    Xan is a depressing person, but he is a capable mage (although he has the
    very large flaw of not being able to cast such spells as Magic Missile and
    Fireball!) and he has a Moonblade.  If you're overly rude to him he'll
    leave and never return.
    Where he is:  Nashkel Mines Interior (Fourth Level, Cave  x 793 y 588)

Enemies: Kobolds, Huge Spiders, Kobold Commandos, Ghoul, Skeletons, Gray Oozes

Treasures:  Ring of Holiness (Fourth Level)
            Short Sword +1 (Fourth Level)

Note for Nashkel Mines:  Any monster that'll kill in these mines will not
                         respawn so you can go back to town for resupplying,
                         healing or resting.

Walkthrough:
  Entry Level:   Head south through the passages until you get to the Door to
                 the next level (x 2106 y 1834).  There's only two Kobolds to
                 kill on this level and they are near the exit to the second
                 mine level.

  Second Level:  When you first arrive here, Miner Beldin will run up to you
                 yelling that the yipping demons (kobolds) are after him.
                 Shortly they appear and attack (usually killing) him.  From
                 the entrance head NE along the passage until you can't go east
                 anymore, then head south to the Door to the next Level at
                 (x 3569 y 2559)

  Third Level:   This level has a lot of traps, so you must be cautious.  Head
                 south to the Bridge (you'll know it when you see it).  Careful
                 while crossing for the Bridge is trapped!  Now head east
                 through the third passage you find (x 1450 y 2500).  There
                 will be some Kobold Commandos shooting their Arrows of Fire at
                 you (ouch!).  This next room has three traps in it so have a
                 Thief disarm them.  If you can't disarm them, you won't be
                 able to avoid them.  So send whoever has the most hitpoints to
                 go trigger the traps, then go through the Door to the next
                 Level (x 3444 y 2338).

  Fourth Level:  Head northeast and then cross the bridge, and go into the
                 cave.  There will be three rooms in here, a north room, an
                 east room, and a south room.  There are usually some monsters
                 to clear out first. If you need a mage go into the
                 east room first and talk to Xan there to get him to join.
                 Then go into the south room and talk to Mulahey there.  It
                 doesn't really matter what you say as he eventually will call
                 the guards in either case. He will "summon" more kobolgs and
                 skeletons to aid him. Don't believe him when he wants to
                 surrender, just kill him.  Loot his body (you NEED the Holy
                 Symbol to collect the Bounty, and the Ring of Holiness gives
                 your cleric +1 spell for every level 1-4). Also be sure to
                 loot the treasure chest he has there too (2 Healing Potions,
                 790 gp, Short Sword +1, lots of spells, etc.).  Take the
                 scrolls in the chest to start Chapter Three.

  Getting Out:   Now you have a choice, you can either go back out the way you
                 came in, or you can continue to the Second Exit.  To go to the
                 2nd Exit, go out of the cave, across the bridge, then north.
                 Follow that path until you reach the exit.  Warning!  Once you
                 go out that way, you can't come back in!  It exits out into
                 the Area NE of Nashkel Mines area.

Subquests:
  - Kylee's Dagger (Entry Level, Second Level)
    A miner will come up to you and ask for you to give a dagger to Kylee,
    agree and he'll give you the dagger.  Give it to Kylee, who is on the
    Second Level to get your reward: 200 exp.

    civilization.

Subquests:
  - Hentold and the Stolen Dagger
    Near the South Center of the area you will find a would-be tomb raider
    named Hentold.  Seems that he stole a dagger from a tomb and ever since has
    been pursued by its previous owner!  He gives you the dagger to give back
    to the creature that was following him.  Go a little to the east to reach
    the cave, go inside and the creature will ask for the dagger back, and once
    it has it, it will die.  You get 900 exp for your trouble.  However, you
    may want to simply kill the foul creature and get 3000 exp instead.  Plus
    you get to keep the dagger.  Feel free to loot this cave too.  Just because
    the last person who did so suffered from a terrible curse doesn't mean that
    you will too!

    the spells off his body (lightning bolt, web). If you don't ask for the
    spell, he will summon 3 green slimes and run away.

    cure Samuel.  Agree to do so.  When you talk to Gellana she'll take Samuel
    off you, and give you your reward: 500 exp, Reputation +1, and 2 potions.

    However, if you don't hurry up to the Friendly Arm Inn, Samuel will die

    trust him, he won't try to kill you.  He'll ask for your name, tell it to
    him and he'll reveal that his dreams have been about you.  Next he wants to
    know your life story, choose the bottom option to tell him your story, and
    he will give you a Protection from Magic scroll.
    Hafiz: Area E of Nashkel Mines (x 830 y 905)

  - Flaming Fist
    There is a Flaming Fist soldier in the western part of the Area.  He asks
    you to identify yourselves, and then says that he is looking for a deserter
    named Samuel.  He'll give you a measely 50gp if you turn Samuel in.  You're
    better off taking Samuel to the healer for Lena.
    Flaming Fist: Area E of Nashkel Mines (x 213 y 2480)

  - Ring of Fire Resistance (from Duncan Clay)
    In a crack in the cliffs around the middle of the map is a Ring of Fire
    Resistance, a Star Sapphire and an Ion Gem.
    Ring:  Area E of Nashkel Mines (x 1955 y 2372)

6. Nashkel Revisited                                                 [6NSHKR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Treasures:  Boots of Avoidance (Assassination Attempts)
            Short Sword +1 (Assassination Attempts)

Plot:
  - We've come back to Nashkel to receive our reward for killing Mulahey and
    clearing out the mines.  Talk to Berrun near the church to get your
    reward:  1000 exp, 900 gp, and a Reputation +1.  Also make sure to go kill
    Nimbul to get his wonderful Boots of Avoidance.

Assassination Attempts: 1
  Near the Nashkel Inn (x 1224 y 717)
  Careful with this one, he casts Fear on you, which makes your people unable
  to fight.
  Nimbul -- 650 exp, Boots of Avoidance, Ring, Short Sword +1, 58 gp


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Beregost Revisited                                                [7BRGTR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Treasures:  Ring of Protection +1 (Plot, Third Item -- Tranzig)
            Wand of Magic Missiles (Plot, Third Item -- Tranzig)

Plot:
  - When you re-enter Beregost after having cleared the Mines, Elminster will
    come up and talk to you again.  He reveals that the Bandits are in the
    North East.  Great.

  - Also Chloe, a mere child, will come up and tell you to meet someone in the
    Jovial Juggler Inn.  Don't worry, it's not another Assassination attempt!
    It's just Officer Vai of the Flaming Fist.  Go inside the Jovial Juggler,
    and Officer Vai will come right up to you.  She asks for your help in
    hunting down all the bandits, and will pay you a bounty of 50 gp for each
    Bandit Scalp that you give her. (you can also sell her books and Winter
    Wolf pelts--at full price, no less!)
    Jovial Juggler: Beregost (x 3768 y 3626)

  - We also have to pay a visit to the Bandits informer in Beregost (assuming
    you read the letters that you got from Mulahey), who is in the Feldepost's
    Inn.  You will find Tranzig on the second floor, in the first room to the
    south of the stairs.  Go in his room and talk to him.  Set your party up
    around him before you talk to him. (makes for easy killing later!)  Tell
    him that you know all about him, and that you aren't afraid of him.  He'll
    attack.  No matter what happens your map will be updated showing the
    location of the secret bandit camp. (i.e. he doesn't need to live!)  Plus
    you get 975 exp, Ring of Protection +1, Wand of Magic Missiles, 91 gp, and
    a Scroll.
    Feldepost's Inn: Beregost (x 1406 y 2640)
    Tranzig: Feldepost's Inn Second Floor (x 196 y 572)

Note: If you sleep in the Inn here, you will have another Dream, and gain
      another ability, again Cure Light Wounds (or Larloch's Minor Drain).

7a. Area E of Temple                                                 [ARFTMP]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions:      S  D  C  I  W  Ch
  - Shar-Teel 18/58 17 9  14 7  11      Human       Fighter        Chaotic Evil
    When you first meet up with Shar-Teel she challenges your "Best Male
    Fighter" (this seems to be randomly chosen) to a duel.  If you don't have a
    Male, you can't get her.  If you turn her down, she leaves forever.
    Where she is:  Area E of Temple (x 273 y 303)

Enemies: Gnoll Slashers, Lesser Basilisks, Basilisks (Korax is very useful
         against these as he can't be petrified!), Tasloi, Brown Bears, Black
         Bears,

Treasures:  Adventurer's Robe (Mutamin's Basilisks)
            2 Long Swords +1 ¯¯|
            Golden Girdle      |__ Kirian the Adventurer
            Bracers AC 7       |
            Morningstar +1   __|

Plot:
  - This is a good place to pick up some experience via Basilisk Hunting.
    Simply go pick up Korax (see Other below) and start hunting!  Save a lot,
    as well, since the Basilisks can kill instantly.

    If you have a mage, and don't want to use Korax, go to High Hedge and buy
    the Protection from Petrification spell. Memorize that 6 times (or as many
    as you can), protect everyone in your party, and go to town.

Subquests:
  - Tamah
    Tamah was fighting some Gnolls and was turned to stone by some basilisks.
    Free her using a Remove Petrification spell/scroll to get your reward of:
    300 exp, and a Reputation +1.
    Tamah: Area E of Temple (x 1410 y 870)

  - Mutamin's Basilisks
    You will encounter Mutamin in the North Central part of the Area.  He is
    the creator and maintainer of these Basilisks (probably to avoid
    solicitors).  Careful!  He has a Greater Basilisk and a Lesser Basilisk by
    him!  He only wants to turn you to stone forever, no biggie.  Kill him and
    take his things (1200 exp, Adventurer's Robe, 120 gp, 2 Heal Potions, 2
    spells)  Also note that the Greater Basilisk by him gives 7000 exp not
    the regular 4000.
    Mutamin: Area E of Temple (x 2158 y 866)

  - Kirian the Adventurer (and friends)
    Another band of Adventurer's can be found around here, and they seem a
    little unimpressed with you.  Depending on how you answer, they either
    leave or fight you.  There are four of them, one has a bow, two fighters,
    and a mage.  They aren't an easy fight if you attack them straight on.
    However, if you stand aways back and launch fireballs at them, they aren't
    so tough. Or, failing that, just charge the mage first, then the archer.
    Treasures: (Lindin--600 exp, Plate Mail, Shield, 2 Potions, Long
    Sword + 1, 76gp; Kirian--900 exp, Golden Girdle, Bracers AC 7, Long
    Sword +1, 3 spells, 163 gp; Baerin--300 exp, Scale, Long Bow, Magic Arrows,
    49 gp; Peter--1200 exp, Chain, 2 potions, Shield, Morningstar +1, 97gp)
    Kirian: Area E of Temple (x 3047 y 1932)


Other:
  - Korax the Ghoul
    There is a "friendly" Ghoul here who goes by the name of Korax.  Say the
    last option to him, and he will be considered "Dire Charmed" (in other
    words you can order him around).  He is useful in fighting the basilisks
    since they can't turn him to stone, therefore the Basilisks can't really
    hurt him!  The only problem with this is you don't really see what Korax is
    doing if you move him off the screen, so you have to send someone with him.
    Once you find a Basilisk, hide that person and let Korax handle it.
    Eventually he will turn against you, so once you get him try to be quick
    with your Basilisk hunting.
    Korax: Area E of Temple (x 441 y 1466)

Note: If you want you can go to the Halfling city of Gullykin to the south, and
      from there to the Firewine bridge, but those areas will be covered later.

Companions: none

Enemies: Kobold Commandos, Kobolds, Skeletons, Zombies, Ghouls, Hobgoblins,
         Hobgoblin Elites, Ghasts

Treasures:  Boots of Stealth (The Hobgoblin's Boots of Stealth)
            Flail +1 (Icharyd)

Plot:
  - Ulcaster has some interesting ruins to explore, the path to the top of the
    cliff on which Ulcaster is located is at (x 3121 y 1974).

  - The Entrance to Ulcaster Dungeon can be found at (x 3054 y 675)

Subquests:
  - Furret's Gem
    In the NW of the Area you will encounter a Halfling named Furret.  He has a
    bridge... I mean, a Gem that he wants to sell you.  A magic gem he claims.
    You really don't want to spend 1000 gp on a Turquoise gem do you?  It isn't
    magic!  You can kill Furret with no loss of reputation.
    Furret: Ulcaster (x 150 y 950)

  - The Wraith of Ulcaster
    Near the Entrance to the Dungeon of Ulcaster you will find the Wraith of
    Ulcaster.  Talk to him a bunch of times until your journal is updated.
    What he wants is a book (any book) from the Dungeon.  Return with the book
    to get your reward: 1000 exp.

    TRICK:  (from Ghostly)  But this book can also be found TWICE in Gullykin
            houses. If you bring Ulcaster those two books, one by one as with
            the Ankheg head in Beregost, you'll get another 1000 xp each time!

    Wraith: Ulcaster (x 2809 y 741)

  - The Vampiric Sword
    If you have both the Ancient Armor from the Firewine Ruins and the Idol of
    Kozah, then when you talk to the Ghost of Ulcaster, he will automatically
    exchange these two items for the Vampiric Sword. ("The Vampire's Revenge"
    is the swords real name, and it isn't that great of a weapon, just
    something to do if you haven't done it before)

    NOTE:  If you have trouble getting this item, I'm pretty sure that it isn't
           in all versions of the game.  Also, you MUST have killed the
           Doomsayer when you got the Idol.

    Wraith: Ulcaster (x 2809 y 741)

Other:
  - The Hobgoblin's Boots of Stealth
    A Hobgoblin near the Center of the Area has some Boots of Stealth on him,
    kill him and make them yours.
    Hobgoblin: Ulcaster (x 2051 y 2628)

  - Icharyd
    When I left Ulcaster I was attacked by Icharyd, a Skeletal Warrior.  (950
    exp, Flail +1)  I'm not sure if he's event triggered, or I just didn't see
    him until then.
    Icharyd: Ulcaster (x 4252 y 1256)

    east from the Dire Wolves room, it's kinda hard to see, but it's at the
    south end of the room.  Beware the Fireball trap in the room at (x 460
    y 1500).  Just past the Second Corpse Treasure is yet another Fireball
    trap. (x 1240 y 1435)  In the room with the Pile of Corpses is another
    Fireball trap (x 1344 y 1157).  Once you've gotten the book you can leave.

         Hobgoblin Elites, Dire Wolves, Ogres, Ogrillons, Black Bears

Treasures:  Two Handed Sword +1 (Arghain)

Plot:
  - Just a few subquests here.

Subquests:
  - Hulrik, the Xvarts, and the Cows
    The farmer Hulrik is having a dreadful time with the Xvarts lately, they
    tend to attack and kill his prize winning cows!  Fight off the Xvarts to
    get your reward: 350 exp, Reputation +1 (If you fail to save the cow, you
    get nothing!)
    Hulrik: Area S of Ulcaster (x 2884 y 2982)

  - Ioin Gallchobhair
    A bandit by the odd name of Ioin wants you to pay the toll for passing this
    way, and that toll is your life.  Pleasant fellow.  I assume that you don't
    want to hand over your life, so fight them.  (Dribben--150 exp, Scalp, Long
    Bow, Minor Treasures; Billy--300 exp, Scalp, Long Bow, Magic Arrows, Minor
    Treasures; Ioin--300 exp, Scalp, Minor Treasures)
    Ioin: Area S of Ulcaster (x 3126 y 1710)

  - Sarhedra's Ogres
    Talk to Sarhedra (she's near the East of the Area) and she'll tell you to
    go kill Ogres to the south of there.  Do just that, return and get your
    reward:  300 exp.
    Sarhedra: Area S of Ulcaster (x 4758 y 1747)

Other:
  - Arghain
    Arghain the Half-Ogre wants your iron and maybe to kill you for fun.  Kill
    him instead (520 exp, Scalp, Two Handed Sword +1, Minor Treasures), and
    beat up on his clan of Half-Ogres.
    Arghain: Area S of Ulcaster (x 1154 y 1190)

  - Corpse
    There is a corpse, who was probably killed by all these Ogres around here,
    who has some treasures: Heal Potion, 59 gp, Oil of Speed.
    Corpse: Area S of Ulcaster (x 4390 y 2759)

  - Ettercap's Treasure                                             (from GRiM)
    The area in question is that south of Ulcaster.  There's a cave with an
    ettercap inside and just outside is one of those hidden sections you'd only
    discover by waving your cursor over it. It's what appears to be a rock, if
    memory serves, (x 1573, y 1486) and within it lies a water opal.

    Ajantis is a simple person, all he wants to do is vanquish evil.
    Where he is:  Farm N of Friendly Arm Inn (x 1572 y 3139)

Enemies: Bandits, Ankhegs (Ankheg shells can either be sold or made into an
         armor, see the Beregost section for more information)

Treasures:  Flail +1 (The Fisherman and the Sea Priestess)

            Dart of Stunning   |
            Dart of Wounding __|

Plot:
  - We're here to pick up the NPC Ajantis (if you want a Paladin, that is), and
    to do the subquests here.

Subquests:
  - The Fishermen and the Sea Priestess
    Seems that whenever these fishermen get out on their boat, a horrible storm
    appears and disrupts their fishing activity.  They blame the Priestess of
    Umberlee, Tenya, for cursing them unjustly--or so they claim.  Agree to
    help them, and go north again to the Baldur's Gate Bridge. (unless you want
    to fight a lot of Ankhegs, when you go north, stay as far to the west as
    you can manage!)  Don't actually cross the bridge, but head as far north as
    you can manage.  Once you have found the Priestess' cottage, save it, and
    move the members of your party around her.  Talk to her, and say that you
    have come to end her "villainous deeds".  After a short battle, she should
    talk to you (if you killed her, reload!) and tells you that the fishermen
    are the real menace here (she's no innocent either).  Go back, talk to the
    fishermen and demand the bowl, then kill the fishermen, and take their
    Flail +1. Give the Bowl to the Priestess to get your reward: 2500 exp.
    Fishermen: Farm N of Friendly Arm Inn (x 700 y 2643)
    Priestess: Baldur's Gate Bridge (x 3989 y 720)

  - Farmer Brun's Son (or the Cave of the Ankheg's)
    Just to the East of the Fishermen you will find Farmer Brun.  It seems that
    his son has gone missing.  Agree to help him.  Go a little to the west to
    what appears to be a giant pit in the ground, and go into it.  Go down the
    tunnels to the east, when you get the option, you usually want to take the
    north path.  Eventually you will find a treasure horde, in which you will
    find Wand of Fire, Chain Mail +1, Dagger +1, Dart of Stunning, Dart of
    Wounding, 2 spells (Dire Charm and Ghost Armor), 3 potions (Cloud Giant
    Strength, Antidote, and Magic Protection), 560 gp, and Nathan's corpse.
    (In case you are wondering, there is nothing else down here except for more
    Ankheg's) Return with the corpse to Farmer Brun's to get your reward:
    500 experience points.

    NCPFLJohn sent me this:

      "After you bring farmer brun his son back from the ankheg pit talk to him
      again and chose to give him 100gp because it is weighing you down. He
      will graciously accept your money and give you 1000 exp and a reputation
      +1."

    Farmer Brun: Farm N of Friendly Arm Inn (x 3492 y 2328)
    Ankheg Pit: Farm N of Friendly Arm Inn (x 2137 y 2404)
    Nathan's Body: Ankheg Pit (x 2458 y 137)

Other:
  - Gerde and the Ankheg Fighting
    You may find Gerde around.  She explains a few things about Ankheg's and
    will let you hunt up to 9 of them.  Kill every Ankheg that you can find on
    the screen and she will give you 75 gp.

  - There are some various minor treasures locked in the 3 houses here.
    Nothing more than about 32 gp though.

Note:  The Baldur's Gate Bridge is important later, and we will come back this
       way again.

       You CANNOT enter Baldur's Gate itself until after the Cloakwood Mine in
       chapter 5.

8. On the Trail of Bandits (Area N of Beregost Revisited)            [8NTHTR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plot:
  - Go to the downed Caravan (x 4291 y 2528), there will be a bunch of bandits
    there.  Kill them, and scalp them.  Now go east and out of the Area to the
    Larswood Forest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Gibberlings, Bandits, Black Talon Elites, Wild Dogs, Dire Wolves,
         Wolves, Brown Bears,

Plot:
  - We're here looking for bandits, and there are two ways to go about this.
    When you find Teven (x 1458 y 2245) you have the option of either joining
    (say the most bloodthirsty thing on there), or attacking.  If you skipped
    by Tranzig you may want to join so that you can find the camp.  But if
    you'd rather just attack, well go for it! (975 exp, Minor Treasure)

  - If you joined up with Teven skip down to section 9. Bandit Camp, if not
    continue on through Peldvale, and from there to the Bandit Camp.

Subquests:
  - Osmadi's Mistake
    In the North East of the Area is a Druid shrine that was being built, but
    the builder's were mostly killed by bandits.  One of the survivors, Osmadi,
    mistakes you for those bandits, and no matter what you say attacks you,
    which pretty much forces you to kill him. (1000 exp, 12 gp, Leather Armor)
    Afterwords talk to the Druid Corsone to find out exactly what happened
    here.

    Jon WolF has this to add:

      Well, yes, you can talk to him to find out what happened. Unless you
      press him, he'll lie however. If you press him, he'll finally confess
      to having poisoned Osmadi (which expalins why he helps you kill
      Osmadi). Of course having confessed to being a murderer, he'll then
      want to kill you as well.

      This also makes Seniyad's warning (Cloakwood Forest) about the Shadow
      Druids much more credible.

    When you first encounter Viconia she asks you to help her with a small
    matter of the Flaming Fist trying to kill her.  Help her out and she offers
    to join.  However, if you turn Viconia down when she asks to join, she
    vanishes forever.  Once she joins your reputation goes down 2.
    Where she is:  Peldvale (x 447 y 731)

Enemies: Bandits, Cave Bears, Brown Bears, Black Bears, Black Talon Elites,
         War Dogs, Wild Dogs, Huge Spiders, Giant Spiders

    Can't find the Bandit Camp?  Go back to Beregost, Feldepost's Inn, Second
    Floor and talk to Tranzig there.

Subquests: none

    In the North you will find a bandit named Raiken who wants to rob you, or
    kill you.  Or both. (650 exp, Chain Mail, M. Shield, War Hammer+1, 31gp)

9.   Bandit Camp                                                     [9BNDTC]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first approach the Bandit Camp you are treated to a little movie
      (on Disc 4) of some Gnolls and a human prisoner.

Companions: none

Enemies: Wild Dogs, Chill Hobgoblins (same as normal Hobgoblins, but can also
         be scalped), Bandits, Gnoll Veterans, Flinds, Gnoll Slashers, Zombies,
         Skeletons

Treasures:  Bow of Marksmanship (Plot, Third Item, Hakt)
            Full Plate       ¯¯|
            Medium Shield +1   |-- Taugosz Khosann
            War Hammer +1    __|

Plot:
  - If you joined up with the Bandits, you will have to prove your worth to
    Tazok by fighting him.  Win and he lets you wander around the camp.

  - Eventually we want to get rid of Tazok.  He is hiding in the Big Tent
    (x 3588 y 900).  As you near the tent you will be attacked by its defenses
    (which may or may not include Taugosz, see subquests below).

  - Inside you will find 4 enemies and that prisoner that you saw in the
    opening movie (the one that opened the area anyway), be sure not to kill
    the prisoner (so don't shoot off random fireballs).  Here's what you get
    from each enemy. (by the way, you may want to get that Mage first, he tends
    to cast Horror, which causes your party to run around like chickens with
    their heads cut off.)  Too bad Tazok wasn't here...
    Venkt:  900 exp, 3 spells, Robe, 2 potions, 92gp
    Raemon:  1200 exp, Scalp, Composite Long Bow, Magic Arrows, 1gp
    Hakt:  750 exp, Bow of Marksmanship, Leather Armor, 62gp
    Britik:  900 exp, Gold Ring, Jade Ring, Garnet Gem, Halberd

  - Now talk to the prisoner here who will explain just a little bit more about
    the bandit groups, and also tell you that your next place to search is the
    Cloakwood Forest.

  - Finally open up that big treasure chest to the left.  It is trapped and a
    lightning bolt will shoot out.  (you may want to disarm the trap)  Take the
    scrolls to get to Chapter 4.  There is also 2000 gp in here and some
    spells.

Subquests:
  - Taugosz Khosann
    Usually hiding out by the big Tent (x 3588 y 900), this nasty fighter has a
    large number of neat treasures after you defeat him.  Treasures:  2000 exp,
    Full Plate, M. Shield+1, War Hammer+1, 105gp.

Other:
  - Treasures
    Regardless of how you got here, you probably want to kill everyone and
    steal everything.  On the exterior map are a lot of little chests, bags,
    etc., with a lot of minor treasures (30-40 gp, daggers).  As you get closer
    to the Big Tent (where Tazok is hiding) the treasures get better, Magic
    Short Swords, and Shields, more gold, potions, etc.  All the chests are
    invariably locked, so I hope you have a good thief handy! (or a Knock
    spell)

  - Huts
    Inside each of the huts you may find enemies, and some more minor
    treasures.

  - Cave
    You can go inside the Cave at (x 2411 y 683).  Inside are some Gnolls that
    are being punished by Tazok.  They started a brawl a few nights ago.

  - Treasures in the Big Tent
    In addition to the main treasure chest (the one that is trapped) in the Big
    Tent, you can also find a potion and about 700 gp in there.

9a. Area E of Larswood (AR 3000)                                     [ARFLRS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Beware of Web Traps that may be in the area!

Companions: none

Enemies: Giant Spiders, Wraith Spiders, Ettercaps, Huge Spiders, Tasloi, Sword
         Spiders, Phase Spiders,

Treasures:  Ring of Energy (Red Wizards)
            Robes of various minor types (Red Wizards)

Plot:
  - Just a subquest and some wizards here.  Also a good place to get experience
    if you like to fight Spiders.

Subquests:
  - Fahrington's Scroll
    The Sage Fahrington had his Scroll of Wisdom stolen by a naughty Tasloi,
    who took off to the east and was killed by Ettercaps.  Go east, kill the
    Ettercaps and retrieve the Scroll (it is a Scroll of Protection, although
    you may find other random scrolls).  Take the scroll back to Fahrington to
    get your reward: 300 exp, and he lets you keep the Scroll.  By the way, the
    scroll is cursed.
    Fahrington: Area E of Larswood (x 1473 y 1067)
    Ettercap: Area E of Larswood (x 3527 y 605)

Other:
  - The Red Wizards
    In the Ruins in the center of the Area are the Red Wizards.  They don't
    like people, and if you go near them they attack.  Your best bet to beating
    them without getting hurt at all is to approach them from the north, and
    when you see the 3 wizards, stop, and launch a fireball or two at them.
    Once all 4 wizards are dead, go in and collect the booty:
    Denak--1200 exp, Ring of Energy, Robe, 2 Heal Potions, 102gp
    Diana--600 exp, Robe, 2 spells, 81gp
    Lasla--30 exp, Robe, 2 spells, 81gp
    Brendann--300 exp, Robe, 2 spells, 81gp

      Note:  If you have Edwin in your party, the Wizards won't attack you
             since Edwin is a Red Wizard. (from Jones)

10. Back to Beregost                                                 [10B2BR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plot:
  - We now need to go back to Beregost to pick up our reward from Officer Vai
    for having killed off the Bandits. (reputation +1)  Of course you have to
    sell her your scalps first...

    Sergio D. Morozov notes the following:

      Officer Vai gives reward to the party and leaves only after party gets
      letters from Bandit Camp AND if party speaks to her WITHOUT any bandit
      scalps in inventory. Thus it is possible to have her present for the
      remainder of the game and sell her goods - party just should not speak to
      her without bandit scalps in inventory.

      Officer Vai pays:
          50 gp for each Bandit Scalp
         500 gp for each Winter Wolf Pelt
        1000 gp for each Wyvern head

After this we have a choice of doing some more areas around here, or going
straight up to Cloakwood.  The walkthrough will go to the Lighthouse, but feel
free to skip straight to Cloakwood.  To get to the Lighthouse we have to go to
the Area W of High Hedge first.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10a. Area W of High Hedge   (AR 3100)                                [ARWFHH]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Wolves, Ghasts, Dire Wolves, Ogrillons, Half-Ogres, Ogres, Ogre
         Berserkers, Carrion Crawlers, Ghouls, Kobolds, Sirines (be careful of
         these, they tend to cast Improved Invisibility and Dire Charm)

Treasures:  Helmet of Defense (Shoal the Nereid)

Plot:
  - Just a few subquests to do here.

Subquests:
  - Shoal the Nereid
    Shoal the Nereid is "lost" and asks for your help to find her way.  Agree
    to help her and she asks for a kiss to show her affection.  Have someone
    (NOT your main character!) kiss her, and she will blast them into a hundred
    pieces.  After that, attack her until she talks to you again.  She says
    that it isn't her intention to kill you.  Ask her to restore your companion
    back to life, and she will do it.  She then explains that she is the
    prisoner of an Ogre Mage who holds her _shawl_ and therefore she is a slave
    to his cruel will.  (you may want to get your companion's gear back from
    the ground)  The Ogre Mage will come to investigate the goings-on here, and
    you will have to attack him.  Kill Droth (975 exp, Helmet of Defense,
    150gp) and then talk to Shoal to get a reward: 750 exp.

    Tip: You can pickpocket a pearl off of Shoal. (Yamian)

    Shoal: Area W of High Hedge (x 2931 y 506)

  - Mad Arcand's Crazy Adventures
    Arcand the Mad (aka Mad Arcand) will also be standing there waiting for you
    to arrive (why don't any of these NPC's seem to ever do anything except
    wait for you to talk to them?).  Talk to him and he asks you to retrieve an
    item from a Pirate Ship that will "make you like me".  Sounds great.  Who
    wouldn't want to be crazy.  Head west and a little to the south to find the
    wrecked ship.  You'll find the treasure at the front of the boat.  You will
    find a Ring.  This is the Ring of Folly.  A cursed ring.  DO NOT PUT IT ON!
    Take it back to Mad Arcand to get your reward:  300 exp, and an Oil of
    Fiery Burning.
    Mad Arcand: Area W of High Hedge (x 2002 y 1275)
    Pirate Ship: Area W of High Hedge (x 859 y 1598)

Other:
  - The Surgeon
    Standing there like a post is the Surgeon, a man clad in black who will
    heal your party for no particularly good reason other than the fact that he
    can.  Sounds great!  Ask him the 3rd option and he will give you a potion
    before healing you (Potion of Magic Protection).
    Surgeon: Area W of High Hedge (x 2884 y 2079)

    Safana wants to find some treasure in the Flesh Golem cave, and afterwords
    she will stay with you forever.
    Where she is:  Lighthouse (x 3750 y 2390)

Enemies: Sirines, Worgs, Dread Wolves, Hobgoblins, Hobgoblin Elites, Taslois,
         Carrion Crawlers, Flesh Golems

Treasures:  Darts of Wounding       ¯¯|

            Wand of Paralyzation      |
            Manual of Bodily Health __|

Plot:
  - There's a decent (and sensual!) thief here and some really neat treasures
    (see the Flesh Golem Cave in Other below).

Subquests:
  - Ardrouine's Lost Boy
    Ardrouine has lost her son in the Lighthouse, and now can't go up there to
    find him because there are Worgs up there.  Go north from her to get to the
    Lighthouse, there you must kill all the Worgs.  You won't find any trace of
    the boy.  I am guessing that you know what happened to him.  Yep, he's
    hiding up in the lighthouse itself and won't come down for mere bloody
    adventurers!  Go back to Ardrouine to get your reward: 500 exp, 60 gp, and
    a Reputation +1.
    Ardrouine: Lighthouse (x 1414 y 3681)
    Lighthouse Ruins: Lighthouse (x 1100 y 2950)

Other:
  - Pallonia, the Bitterest Seer
    Near the center of the Area you will be approached by a seer named
    Pallonia, but she doesn't offer you any useful information, merely telling
    that there are mighty forces at work in the world.
    Pallonia: Lighthouse (x 3425 y 1580)

  - Arkushule, the Reluctant Seer
    There is another Seer south of Pallonia.  This one will start to read your
    palm, but just when she gets to something interesting, she stops and wants
    her money.  Seems she saw something that scared her, and she won't tell you
    what.  If you demand to know, she will attack you (600 exp, Robe, 1 Spell,
    38 gp) or you can just give her the money (she'll refuse to take it).
    Arkushule: Lighthouse (x 3498 y 2955)

  - Flesh Golem Cave (Manual of Bodily Health--Constitution +1!)
    You'll find the Entrance to the Cave in the NW of the Area by the Coast.
    Oh and it is guarded by three pesky Sirines (one of which has a name, Sil).
    The strategy to beat them can be found below in the Monster & Monster
    Strategies section.  It takes awhile, but a lot less people die that way.
    Go into the cave.  There are bunches of Flesh Golems in here.  Take a left
    until you get to the room with the water in it.  There is an island there,
    move your mouse over it and you will see that it is filled with treasure.
    Treasure: 4 potions, 10 Darts of Wounding, Cloak of the Wolf, Wand of
    Paralyzation, Manual of Bodily Health, 312 gp.  After that if you have
    Safana she'll offer to become a permanent member of the party.

10c. Area S of Lighthouse (AR 4100)                                  [CRSFLS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Gnolls, Gnoll Slashers, Gnoll Chieftan, Gnoll Elites, Flinds, Gnoll
         Veterans, Ghouls, War Dogs, Hobgoblins, Kobold Commandos, Cave Bears,
         Tasloi, Diggers, Doomsayer, Huge Spiders, Black Bears

Treasures:  Cursed Two Handed Sword of Berserking +3 (The Insane Captain Brage)

Plot:
  - There are some really good subquests to do here, namely taking care of
    Captain Brage (from Nashkel) and the Archeological Dig.

Subquests:
  - The Archeological Dig for the Evil Idol
    In the Center of the Area are some ruins that are being excavated for
    profit.  Talk to the foreman Charleston Nib, and he will ask for your
    protection.  Seems a variety of small "accidents" have been plaguing the
    camp.  Agree to help defend the camp.  Then one of the diggers, Gallor,
    will come up to you with another proposition, this one quite a bit more
    bloody (he wants you to kill everyone here to keep all the loot for
    yourselves).  If you are an evil person you could do what he asks,
    otherwise tell him no.  Now talk to Charleston again and they will have
    found something inside the ruins.  A quick cutscene later and you are
    inside.  The diggers will go insane due to the god Kozah, and you will have
    to kill them.  Once they're dead talk to Charleston to get your reward:
    1000 exp, and a Reputation +1.  If you would like a challenge, open the
    tomb and take the Idol.  When you leave the Ruins a Doomsayer will attack
    you, and they ain't easy to kill!  (4000 exp)

      Note:  If you want the Vampiric Sword, be sure to keep the Idol, and take
             this item as well as the Ancient Armor from the Firewine Ruins to
             the Ghost of Ulcaster to exchange these items for the Vampiric
             Sword. The sword isn't very good, though.

    Kelvin Groves sent me this:

      I have discovered a flawless way to defeat the Doomsayer without even
      taking a hit.  To do this you will need to be playing multiplayer and
      have someone who can either read a scroll or cast the spell Skull Trap
      (Mage Lvl 3 - necromancy).  It would also help to have some sort of
      summoning scroll or wand or spell - Monster Summoning or Animate Dead,
      you get the drift...

      First, have this spell memorised before talking to anyone.  Then talk to
      all the people and go inside and do all the storyline bit and kill the
      diggers.  Do not get the idol.  Do not even TOUCH it.  Take all of your
      party except for one person back outside the cave.  Make sure that the
      person with Skull Trap is Outside.

      Have that person cast the spell down near where the Doomsayer appears --
      If you aim for the top of that big christmas tree in the foreground you
      can't miss.

      Then switch back to the person inside the cave and pick up the idol.  The
      instant you do this the Doomsayer will appear triggering the Skull Trap
      and hopefully not damaging a single one of your characters -- keep them
      well back from the range of the spell.

      Now I know as well as you do that one Skull trap will not kill the
      Doomsayer no matter what level you are on.  BUT here's the glitch.  For
      some reason when you switch characters back to the person inside the cave
      the Skull trap MULTIPLIES into about a dozen. I do not know why but I
      don't really care.  If you are really quick you can change characters
      back outside straight after you pick up the idol and watch them all
      explode -- VERY FUN !!!

      After the rubble fades away there will probably still be a few [traps]
      left!  If you placed the spell at the top of that tree you can walk
      single file around them to the right without setting them off, but it is
      much easier to just summon some creatures and send them to set the traps
      off for you...

      I am fairly sure that this is how it works. It has been a while since I
      tried it.  If this does not work, try taking the WHOLE party outside
      before touching the idol, cast the spell, and send someone back in after
      the idol; or you could cast the spell before you even ENTER the cave (but
      that might kill the people outside).  But the first way should work...

      You could also try some sort of variation on this to get it to work in a
      single-player game, but multi-player is so much better anyway.

    Dig Site: Area S of Lighthouse (x 2900 y 1500)

  - The Insane Captain Brage
    Just to the south and east of the Ruins you will find Captain Brage.  He
    walks right up to you and asks you a riddle, the answer is DEATH.  Now you
    have a choice of what to do with him.  Offer to take him to the Temple of
    Helm, and you will immediately be there.  The Priest offers Brage some
    forgiveness and you get a reward: 1000 exp, Reputation +1, Cursed 2 Hnd
    Sword of Berserking +3, and 1000 gp.

    Alternatively:  If you approach his place by the west, you will see
    (from Tonton    Laryssa, Brage's cousin. She will talk to you as soon as
    Fred)           she sees you (no need to get close). If you choose the
                    first reply (who is Brage ?), she will leave you alone and
                    you can take care of the Captain. But if you choose the
                    second reply, she will attack you. Be careful, she is a
                    cleric, although a weak one. She is worth 600 exp and
                    carries a Shield +1, if I remember correctly. Now the
                    problem is, if you get close to her, you will reveal Brage,
                    who will come up and talk to you. If you kill him too,
                    that's ok, since you stay on the map, you can loot both
                    bodies. But what if you wanna have the shield AND take
                    Brage to the Temple of Helm?

                    The solution I found was to send archers/spellcasters to
                    take her down with ranged attacks from as far as possible
                    (ie not activating Brage behind her). When she went down,
                    two characters would get close, one of them acting as a
                    bait for Brage. Since Brage needs to be in contact to start
                    the dialog, just lead him away with one of you characters,
                    paying attention not to let him get close enough to talk to
                    you, while the other character can ruthlessly search the
                    body of her unfortunate cousin (aren't we sweet). Once you
                    get the shield, stop the first character, so that Brage
                    talks to him and go the Temple of Helm.

Other:
  - Bar'uk the Hobgoblin (be quiet!)
    Near the western section of this area you will encounter a surly Hobgoblin
    by the name of Bar'uk.  You'll know that it's him because he demands that
    you "be quiet"!  If you taunt him, he'll have some Kobold Commandos attack
    you. (165 exp, Composite Long Bow, and other minor treasures)

    The Tasloi who stole Gurke's cloak can be found here at the eastern side of
    the area.  Get the cloak and return it to Gurke in the Jovial Juggler in
    Beregost to get your reward: 300 exp, and you get to keep the Cloak of
    Non-Detection.

  - The long tale of Aldeth Sashenstar (this is entirely from Andy Miller)
    In front of the hunting lodge there, I ran into a fellow named Aldeth
    Sashenstar, yelling for help.  He told me that some druids had killed his
    friends simply because they had been hunting in the area, and asked my
    help in protecting him from them.  I agreed.  Then a group of three druids
    walks up; the leader's name is Seniyad.  He then asks me to step aside so
    that he can take care of Aldeth, claiming that rather than being a simple
    hunter, Aldeth had actually killed some druids.  Aldeth of course denies
    this.

      Tip: Before talking to Aldeth and picking a side, pick his pockets for
           some potions, a diamond, and the Bastard Sword +1, +3 vs.
           Shapeshifters. This can be repeated when you meet him again in
           Baldur's Gate.
           (from Josh Clue)

    Here there are two choices.  If you defend Aldeth, you have to kill the
    three druids, getting some nice exp from the kills (Seniyad is worth 4000
    exp, as you noted elsewhere in your FAQ), and Aldeth tells you to stop by
    the Manycoins Merchant League if you're every in Baldur's Gate, and he'll
    help you out. (More on that later.) If you side with the druids, you kill
    Aldeth, and the druids warn you about a dangerous group of Shadow Druids
    lurking deeper in the Cloakwood Forest.  In either case, you get 2000 exp
    for the miniquest when it's all done.

    I decided to save the game in which I helped Aldeth, for the simple reason
    that Seniyad's exp was better than Aldeth's, and so that I could check out
    the Manycoins Merchant League in Baldur's Gate. As it later turns out that
    the Shadow Druids are allies against Davaeorn, it seems that Seniyad and
    his buddies can't be trusted (they warned me against the Shadow Druids,
    remember).

    Anyway, once I got to Baldur's gate, I paid a visit to the Manycoins
    Merchant League.  Aldeth Sashenstar was standing outside, and he asked for
    my help again (boy, this guy sure knows how to attract trouble!).  It
    seems that his business partners have been acting VERY strange lately
    (making very bad business decisions, etc.), and he wanted me to
    investigate.  I agreed, and went inside.  I talked to the head guard in the
    Merchant League (whose name escapes me now), told him I was working for
    Aldeth, and he asked me to try to find some hard evidence against the other
    two business partners (whose names also escape me).  In one of the
    partners' offices (on the second floor of the building), I found some
    letters indicating that the business partners are actually doppelgangers
    (just like in the Seven Suns).  I took the letters to the head guard, and
    immediately a fight broke out as all the doppelgangers reverted to their
    natural form.  After I slayed all the doppelgangers on the first and second
    floor, I talked to Aldeth again to get my exp/gp award.  (There is also a
    horde of doppelgangers on the third floor to take care of, if one so
    desires, and some fairly nice treasures throughout the building.)

      Tip: At this point, your need for Aldeth and his profitable nature
           expires. You should consider punishing him for slaying those druids
           in the Cloakwood Forest, and gaining an additional 650 XP in the
           process. Why would you want to do that? Well, this way, his brother
           Dabron, who holds the Heavy Crossbow of Accuracy, will now be out on
           the hunt for you! Please see 15e. Baldur's Gate Central Section
           (AR 0700) for more details. In summary, using this unorthodox
           approach, we have the best of both worlds, exploiting both scenarios
           wherein we helped Aldeth but still got the Heavy Crossbow of
           Accuracy not to mention multiple copies of the Bastard Sword +1, +3
           vs. Shapeshifters. (from Josh Clue)

  - Tiber, his Brother, the Spiders, and the Spider's Bane
    Just to the north and west of where you enter this area for the first time
    (it's really in the south east corner of the area) you will find Tiber.  He
    tells the tale that his brother is trapped in a spider infested area of the
    forest.  They had found the sword the Spider's Bane and thought that they
    could easily kill all spiders.  They were wrong.  Agree to help him and
    he'll tell you that his brother's name is Chelak.  You will find a small
    Cave-like thing a ways to the west, go inside to find the Spider Queen,
    Centeol.  After a brief Villainy speech she sets her spiders to attack you.
    There are 2 Sword Spiders, some Giant Spiders, and some Ettercaps, as well
    as the Queen herself. (1000 exp)  Search by the Queen to find Chelak.
    There is also some other good treasure here like: The Spider's Bane, 2
    Rings (one is cursed), and a Wand.  Return the body to get an extra 800
    exp.

    Note: Centeol was cursed by Jon Irenicus to become the Spider Queen.

            Robe of the Evil Archmagi (Fourth Level, Davaeorn)
            Bracers AC 8 (Fourth Level, Davaeorn)

Walkthrough:
  Entry Level:  Wander up the northern passage to get to (x 1980 y 240) and
                talk to the Miner who is standing in front of the Giant Plug.
                Agree to help free him, and he'll tell you how to destroy the
                Mine.  All you have to do is get the Key from the Keeper of the
                Mine.  You can talk to all the Miner's here, some you can free,
                some ask for you to kill them.  Go to (x 1450 y 1500) to get to
                the next level.

  Second Level: Head South East to (x 1387 y 605), and from there South West to
                (x 1019 y 1143).  Be careful, there are 2 lightning traps here.
                Here is a very large group of people for you to kill.  The Mage
                has an Adventurer's Robe and some Spells.  Talk to Rill at
                (x 710 y 1634) and give him the 100 gp to free the slaves.  You
                can also pick up Yeslick on this level.  The stairs to the
                next level are at (x 385 y 1610).

  Third Level:  You will enter into a room filled with enemies (immediately
                at the start so be ready for some brawling).  There are all
                sorts of treasures to be found on this level, as well as lots
                of enemies (that constantly re-spawn).  The northern section
                has most of these treasures (in chest and furnitures so be
                thorough).  There is an Ogre-Mage near (x 2977 y 1921).  Once
                you are done up there, go southwards.  Go to the Forge at
                (x 1825 y 2680) and from there go south east.  The passage to
                the next level is at (x 2712 y 2860).

  Fourth Level: Davaeorn is on this level.  Be careful to check for traps, as
                when they trigger, Battle Horrors (very nasty enemy) appear.
                There are 3 traps, the first at (x 1267 y 523).  Find them and
                disarm them.  There is a fourth one just past those, disarm it
                as well.  Now you should find Davaeorn and kill him (6000 exp,
                Traveller's Robe, Robe of the Evil Archmagi, Bracers AC 6, Key,
                3 Scrolls, 4 Spells, 109gp) to start Chapter 5.  Be sure to get
                all the treasure on this level.  Go to the Elevator at (x 270
                y 1168) to get back to the Entry Level.

               KyleEChu sent me this:
                 "If you attack him immediately, he summons Battle Horrors (not
                 a fun battle) and starts teleporting around while slinging
                 powerful spells.  Instead of attacking him immediately, do the
                 following:  after your thief disarms the 4 traps, use stealth
                 mode to scout out where Davaeorn is standing, then stash your
                 thief in one of the side rooms.

                 "Have your mage or cleric step forward and cast Dispel Magic
                 towards Davaeorn to knock out his shield and mirror images.
                 Do not let him see you do this.  Don't save your game at this
                 point, because he automatically recasts them every time you
                 load the area.  Let your mage now step forward and cast
                 Stinking Cloud at him.  Again, don't let him see you do this!
                 Wait a few moments for the spell to knock him out.  When he
                 falls unconscious, move up and let him have it with projectile
                 weapons!  He will die quickly, and your party will not have
                 taken a scratch."

                 Editor's Note:  Instead of the Stinking Cloud (which I didn't
                                 have), I just sent out some Summoned Monsters.
                                 Once he wasted all his spells on them, I
                                 attacked with my party.

  Entry Level: Go back to the River Plug and talk to the Miner there.  Tell him
               that you talked to Rill and he'll open it up.  A short movie
               later and you get control back, outside again.  Depending on
               your actions inside (if you didn't talk to Rill and give him the
               100gp then you get less) you get your reward: 2000 exp, and a
               Reputation +2.

  You can now enter the City of Baldur's Gate.

  - Stephan -- Fourth Level

    Talk to Gandolar a couple times and he'll ask you to clear out the Firewine
    ruins of their kobold menace.  He tells you that there is a "secret
    entrance" to the ruins in the winery.  Once you've disposed of Jenkal and
    the Ogre Mage (see Jenkal's Kobolds below) he'll give you a meager reward
    of 250 gp.

    Gandolar has Leather Armor +1. After claiming reward for clearing Firewine
    Ruins party might wish to take him to wolf hunting (charm him before he
    runs away, then find some respawning monsters). And wolves may kill him.
    Party may then retrieve his armor. (from Sergio D. Morozov)

    Gandolar:  Gullykin (x 720 y 1210)

  - Jenkal's Kobolds
    In the basement of Jenkal's Home you will find the surliest halfling of
    all, Jenkal.  He is so surly that he is quite suspicious.  Accuse him of
    smuggling in Kobolds, and he'll admit to it, and attack you.  Also once
    that is done you will see a hidden door appear.  If you go into the door it
    will take you directly into the Firewine Ruins, more specifically to the
    Ogre Mage within.

Plot:
  - Beyond picking up the Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise from Meilum, the only
    thing to do here is to go into the Ruins (x 4000 y 2000).

Subquests:
  - Carsa's Jar, or Karhk the Greatest Ogre Mage
    Talking with Mad Carsa doesn't really get you anywhere (she's just to the
    north of the bridge).  Demand that she give you the Jar, and she'll refuse.
    Keep demanding it until she unleashes the Ogre Mage Karhk.  He'll come up
    to you and talk to you (after killing Carsa of course), and then attack.
    Kill him to get 3500 exp, 3 Gems, and 150 gp.  (When I killed Karhk a
    different time he gave me different -- better -- treasures, a Laeral's Tear
    Necklace for example)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: What makes this dungeon tough isn't the type of enemy you fight, it's how
      many of them there are.  Not only are there a lot of Kobold Commandos to
      start with, but they constantly re-spawn making it hard to get anywhere.

Enemies: Kobold Commandos, Ogre Mage, Kobolds, Ogrillons, Ghost Knights

Plot:
  - The only real thing to do here is to find the Ogre Mage (x 575 y 250) and
    kill him.  The easiest way to do this is described in the Gullykin section
    under the Jenkal subquest.

Subquests:
  - The Ancient Armor
    In one of the corridor's you will encounter an undead knight who asks you
    to strike him down and take his armor.  Do so.  Later in the passage you
    will encounter a Ghost Knight which asks for the armor.  The armor and the
    ghosts vanish and you get your reward:  1500 exp.

      Note:  (from Sergio D. Morozov) Ghost Knights have a Longbow of
             Marksmanship +2 on them, which can be pickpocketed. As far as I
             recall they do not have it in plain BG, only in [BG + ToSC] or
             [Original Saga]. I have pickpocketed it from the topmost ghost
             knight, but maybe it is irrelevant which ghost knight to
             pickpocket. Anyway, they only have one bow. Also blur effect can
             be dispelled from them. Funny.

      Note:  If you want to pick up the Vampiric Sword, be sure to keep the
             Ancient Armor, and take this item as well as the Idol of Kozah to
             Ulcaster, there talk to the Ghost of Ulcaster to exchange the two
             items to get the Vampiric Sword. (You must also kill the Doomsayer
             when you get the Idol)

    where's the fun in that?  For killing him you get 1400 exp, Robe, 4 Spells,
    2 Potions, 150 gp.

  - Quayle       8  15 11 17 10 6     Gnome  Cleric/Illusionist Chaotic Neutral
    Quayle is an insulting little person, who will join up for no apparant
    reason.  No matter which direction you say that you are going, he is going
    that way too.  Can't get him until the Cloakwood mines are cleared.
    Where he is:  Baldur's Gate Bridge (x 486 y 797)

Plot:
  - As you cross the Bridge you will be accosted by a Flaming Fist Soldier who
    demands that you pay them a tax.  Give him the "Nymph's" comment and he'll
    make you talk to his commander, Scar.  He asks if it was you who has been
    causing such a ruckus lately, say that it was.  He asks for your help,
    agree to give it.  He wants you to break into the Seven Suns compound in
    the SW corner of the city.

  - Head west to enter Baldur's Gate itself.  However, if you head north from
    the Baldur's Gate side of the Bridge you can get to a new area, the Farm
    N of Baldur's Gate Bridge.

Subquests:
  - Nester's Dagger
    Just slightly to the north of Tenya's home an Ankheg may appear, kill him
    and take the dagger on his corpse.  We will take this to Quinn in the NW
    Section of Baldur's Gate later (check that section for more information).

15. Baldur's Gate (AR 0800)                                          [15BDLR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first enter Baldur's Gate you are "treated" to a little movie,
      which is on Disc 5.  After that Elminster will come up to you and tell
      you that you can trust Scar of the Flaming Fist, as well as his
      commander, Duke Eltan.  Navigating Baldur's Gate can be a little tricky
      due to the wall in the center of town which prevents you from simply
      crossing from one end of the city to the other.

Baldur's Gate is divided into 9 sections, and as such, this section is divided
into 9 sub-sections, one for each of the city sections. (plus another one for
the sewers)

Companions: none

Enemies: none

Treasures: Tome of Dexterity (Niklos and the Bandits)

Plot:
  - There are a lot of things in Baldur's Gate worth doing, subquests and
    very good treasures.

Subquests:
  - Brevlik's Telescope
    In the Elfsong tavern is a wheezy gnome named Brevlik who wants you to
    steal a telescope from the Hall of Wonders.  Agree to help him out, and
    try to increase your fee as well.  Now all you have to do is to break
    into the Hall of Wonders.  You'll find the Hall of Wonders in the W
    Section of the city.  Break into it at night (you'll probably find Alora
    there, see the Baldur's Gate W Section below for more information, if you
    have Alora in your party you'll be able to steal things here without them
    noticing), and steal the Telescope.  Return it to Brevlik to get your
    reward:  5500 exp, 500 gp, and a Lightning Wand.
    Brevlik:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1800 y 2370)
    Telescope:  W Section (AR 0600, x 1600 y 2200)

      MartectX recommends this:

        While in the Hall of Wonders charm ALL people running around (get
        Nymph's cloak first!) and quicksave. Now unlock the chests and get a
        Rogue Stone (worth 2500gp!) and a star sapphire! If someone recognizes
        you anyway - determine him/her, reload and search for that person:
        Charm him/her.

  - Arkion's Corpse
    A Necromancer who lives in the southern part of this area wants you to find
    him a body from the Sewers and bring it to him.  You can find a corpse
    in the sewers that are under the SW Section of the city.  There are 2 more
    corpses in the W Sewers.  You only need one corpse, however.  Take it to
    Arkion to get your reward:  250 gp, and 1800 exp.
    Arkion:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1600 y 3200)
    Corpse:  SW Sewers (AR 0224, x 2520 y 2360)
    Corpses:  W Sewers (AR 0225, x 3700 y 2860)

  - The love triangle of Ordulinian, Nemphre and Arkion
    This subquest should be tackled only once you completed the Arkion's Corpse
    subquest (see above) and Nemphre subquest (see Baldur's Gate SE Section).
    Although he may not ask you to, give him Arkion's Bloostone Amulet and
    Nemphre's Onyx Ring to get 3500 exp.  He's in The Sorcerous Sundries.
    Ordulinian:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800 x 1025 y 1950)
    Arkion:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1600 y 3200)
    Nemphre:  SE Section (AR 1300, x 1750 y 240)

  - Niklos and the Bandits
    In the center of the Area you will find a bandit named Niklos.  He says
    that his boss wants to talk to you, and gives you 50gp just to talk to him.
    He tells you to go into the building to the north of him, and if asked for
    a password to reply "fafhrd", there to meet with the boss.  Go inside the
    building, give the guard your password, and go further in.  All the way to
    the back is a man named Alatos, the Boss.  Talk to him.  Be careful what
    you say, as they might attack you.  What he wants you to do is to steal
    some items from Oberon's House in order to prevent the construction of "Sky
    Ships".  You get 10 days to complete this quest.  Once agreed to, you have
    free run of the Guild.  For more information go down to the section titled
    Baldur's Gate Central Section and look under the subquest marked "Oberan's
    Estate."  Once you have the items return them to the Thieves' Guild.  Now
    you give him the items and you get a reward of 4000 exp, however, the
    client thinks that you were too "messy" in your operation and wants to
    terminate you, but if you did the Narlen Subquest below, Narlen will come
    in and kill the client instead, and you are thereafter a full member of the
    Thieves' Guild.

    NOTE:  Even if you simply sneak in and steal the pieces, Resar still tries
           to have you killed.

    Niklos:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1550 y 1790)
    Boss:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1450 y 1250)
    Oberan's House:  Central Section (AR 0700, x 3400 y 100)

      MartectX adds this:

        Sure, Black Lily sells a lot of good items, but what's in that barrel
        behind her? Uhuu, a low-cost Tome of Dexterity!

  - Narlen Darkwalk's Thievery Test
    In the Thieves' Guild you will encounter Narlen Darkwalk who wants to test
    your thievery abilities.  Agree to it, and he'll ask for a THIEF (and only
    a thief) to meet him by the Splurging Surgeon Inn.  Go there.  (It's a
    little tricky to get to where we need to be.  Go west to the Central
    Section and then North to the North Section, and finally go East to the NE
    Section)  Talk to Narlen again, and you'll be automatically taken to where
    you need to be.  Eventually a Flaming Fist will come up to you and ask what
    you're doing.  Yell out a warning to your "mates", and flee back to the
    Thieves' Guild.  (Don't fight the Fist!)  You will get 100 gp for the first
    job, and another job will be given out.

    This time we're stealing a Rogue Stone from Gantolandan.  This time he
    wants to meet up at the Blade and Stars Inn, which is in the SE Section of
    the city.  Meet up with Narlen there, and then follow him to Gantolandan's
    house.  Go inside and steal the stone (for more information on this go down
    to the SE Section below and look under the Gantolandan in "Other"), and
    then return to the Guild again.  Talk to Narlen for the last time to get 3
    Pearls. (the Rogue Stone, if you had sold it, is worth 2500 gp, while 3
    Pearls are worth 300... methinks someone here took more than their fair
    share!)
    Narlen:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1450 y 1250)
    Splurging Surgeon Inn:  NE Section (AR 0300, x 500 y 2970)
    Blade and Stars Inn: SE Section (AR 1300, x 200 y 666)

Other:
  - Four Mages
    On the second floor of the Sorcerous Sundries are a quartet of mages who
    are practicing spells.  They are very put out if you go near them, and will
    attack you.
    Oulam--1200 exp, Robe, minor treasures
    Wheber Ott--1500 exp, Robe, minor treasures
    William Garst--1500 exp, Robe, minor treasures
    Niemain--2000 exp, Cursed Ring of Clumsiness, Wand of Fire, 280 gp

      Note:  If you have Xzar in your party, the Mages here won't attack you
             since Xzar is a member of their order.

    Sorcerous Sundries:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1025 y 1950)

  - Husam the Bandit
    Inside the Bandit's hideaway (see Niklos and the bandits above) you can
    talk to Husam.  He has a bit of information on the Iron Throne, like who
    the leaders are, and what their plans are.
    Husam:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1450 y 1250)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first come into this area from the first BG Section, you will
      confronted by two goons from the Iron Throne, Marek and Lothandar.  They
      tell you to stay out of Throne business and leave.  Also this area is
      divided in half by the inner wall.

Companions: none

Enemies: none

Treasures:  Cloak of Balduran (Quenash and the Cloak of Balduran)
            Gauntlets of Weapon Skill (Larze the Would Be Ogre Assassin)

Plot:
  - Just some subquests to do.

Subquests:
  - Brielbara and Yago's Book of Curses
    A mage of minor power here has a task for you.  Her daughter was cursed by
    the mage Yago, and in order to remove the curse, you need to retreive his
    book of Curses.  You can find Yago in the Low Light Tavern (it's really a
    boat) at the Harbor.  Go in and take him out (he is on the third level).
    Once that is done return with the book to the Splurging Surgeon Inn and
    give it to Brielbara to get your reward:  200gp, 1000 exp, and a Reputation
    +1.

    I got this from Peter Cheong Choon Wah:
    Apparently Coran was Brielbara's lover and her daughter's true father.  If
    you approach Brielbara with Coran in your party, she would badger him about
    this turn of events; Coran would be forced to do something about Yago and
    he would ask if you/the party would aid him. (I can not confirm, but if you
    refuse in this case, Coran *might* leave the party to settle the issue
    himself...)

    When you help Coran to settle the matter and return to Brielbara, after she
    rewards you, she would have one last tiff with Coran, asking if he's ready
    to be a responsible father.  Coran would be uncertain and she would depart,
    leaving him with your party.
    Brielbara:  NE Section (AR 0300, x 715 y 2250)
    Low Lantern:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 3420 y 3090)
    Splurging Surgeon:  NE Section (AR 0300, x 411 y 2885)

  - Larze the Would Be Ogre Assassin
    In the Blushing Mermaid Tavern you find yet another assassination attempt,
    this time from a none-too-bright Ogre named Larze.  If you want you can
    talk him out of attacking you (900 exp).  Or you could attack him, which I
    think may be the better course of action.
    Larze--2000 exp, Gauntlets of Weapon Skill, 1 Spell, Minor Treasures
    Blushing Mermaid:  NE Section (AR 0300, x 200 y 1750)

Other:
  - Quenash & the Cloak of Balduran
    Quenash in the Undercellars somehow got a hold of the Cloak of Balduran.
    Find her and steal it from her to get a really really good cloak (that 25%
    Magic Resistence will come in handy!).  To get into the Undercellars go
    through the back door in the Blushing Mermaid.
    Quenash:  Undercellars (x 1300 y 1315)

      Silviu has more Info on the Cloak:

        The woman that possesses the Cloak of Balduran is in reality the lover
        of the elf you delivered in Felonius Gist.  There is a hint in the
        letter he gives you that points to her, when he says that the cloak is
        with his "fallen angel"(a prostitute).  If you go to see her, you can
        obtain the cloak from her by saying that you are one of his friends and
        by describing him.

  - Kill the Mustard Jellies
    After talking three times to a drunk named Lusselyn, he will bet you 100gp
    that you cannot kill the mustard jelly upstairs. Upon completion of the
    quest, you will discover that Lusselyn has only 60gp remaining, having
    spent the rest on "Boozsh an' schtuff".
    (from Arashikage The Magnificent, Illusionist Without Peer)
    Lusselyn:  Splurging Surgeon, NE Section (AR 0300, x 411 y 2885)

  - Always Keep the Pantaloons! (from Sir Erik Esoteric)
    A man on the 2nd floor of the Splurging Surgeon named Mr. Shade provides
    a funny conversation if you pretend to play along with it. Eventually, you
    will have to confess, but you can ask him what this was all about.
    Apparently, he was waiting for the owner of the golden pantaloons, and
    since you have obviously stolen them, he decides to take them from you and
    leave. I didn't want to sacrifice getting the Big Metal Unit in BG II ToB,
    so I decided to kill him netting 1 experience point (w00t) and getting back
    the precious pants. All in all, I just thought it was a pretty funny
    interaction.

Companions: none

Enemies: none

Treasures:  Light Crossbow +1 (Taxek and Michael, Bandits)
            Long Sword +1 (Gantolandan's Rogue Stone)

Plot:
  - Just some subquests to do here.

Subquests:
  - Nemphre
    To get Nemphre to even talk to you, you must talk to her with any male in
    your party.  (There goes that all female party!)  She wants you to get an
    amulet back from her former flame, Arkion.  You'll find Arkion back in the
    first Baldur's Gate section in the southern part of that area.  Go into his
    house, don't bother talking to him, and steal the Bloodstone Amulet.  Take
    it back to Nemphre to get called a fool (but a sweet fool!), and receive a
    small reward:  1000 exp, and the spell Vampiric Touch.
    Nemphre:  SE Section (AR 1300, x 1750 y 240)
    Arkion:  Baldur's Gate (AR 0800, x 1600 y 3200)

    Alternatively... Starlight sent me this:
      "I went and retrieved nemphres amulet and took offence at being called a
      fool, albeit a sweet fool.  So after saving the game I  tried to charm
      her so I could rob her, this did not work, so still feeling verbally
      abused I set all five of my party on to her.  I have a heroic reputation
      (20) after her death which was quick, in Another life maybe she will hold
      her tongue, no flaming fist arrived so I ransacked the place and found:

        Cloak of Protection +1
        War Hammer
        Minor Gem
        18 Gold Pieces
        And on her
        Robe of Electrical resistance
        Bloodstone Amulet
        Onyx Ring
        And a Dagger

      I reckon just short of 3000 gp not a bad earner wouldn't you say.

  - G'Axir the Seer
    In the Blade and Stars Inn you will meet a seer named G'Axir who wishes
    to tell your fortune, but requires a Sphene Gem to do such a task.  Find
    one and bring it back to him (if you'd rather just cheat it, it's MISC37)
    and he'll give you your fortune and a reward of 1000 exp.
    G'Axir:  SE Section (AR 1300, x 200 y 666)

  - Nadarin's Basilisk
    Someone decided to ship a basilisk somewhere, and somehow it escaped and is
    wreaking havoc at the harbor.  Talk to Nadarin in the warehouse to get the
    quest, then head over to the harbors.  You will find the Basilisk in a
    warehouse, once inside you will be warned that it is in there.  Kill it
    (it has a Sphene Gem if you need one for G'Axir) and then return to
    Nadarin.  Your Reward:  1300 exp, and 1800 gp.
    Nadarin:  SE Section (AR 1300, x 800 y 1930)
    Basilisk:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 3264 y 1146)

Other:
  - Taxek and Michael, Bandits
    Taxek and his buddy Michael are from the Thieves' Guild have decided to rob
    a house in this area.  You have several options on how to handle this, but
    the best is to say that it isn't your house, but that you aren't going to
    let them leave.  They will attack you, kill them and steal their treasures.
    Taxek--975 exp, Light Crossbow +1, Magic Bolts, 2 Gems, 75gp
    Michael--300 exp, Magic Arrows, 2 Gems, Long Bow, 54 gp
    Bandits:  SE Section (AR 1300, x 1733 y 1075)

  - Gantolandan's Rogue Stone (or the Stray Cat Thief)
    On the second story of a house in this area you will encounter a sleeping
    man named Gantolandan.  Near his bed is a trapped chest with a Rogue Stone
    inside (very valuable! 2500gp!), but as you steal it, Gantolandan will wake
    up and ask "Who's there?"  You could impersonate a cat and say "Meow".
    Take the Rogue Stone, and he'll say "I don't own a cat".  Claim to be a
    stray and he'll go back to bed.  It's fairly safe to leave.  Or you could
    just kill him to get 1200 exp, Long Sword +1, 64gp.  This is the second of
    Narlen's tests if you care about the Thieves' Guild.

Plot:
  - There are some subquests to do here, as well as the Gauntlets of Weapon
    Skill.

  - The Iron Throne Tower
    You can find the Iron Throne's Headquarters in this area to the North West.
    Go inside.  When you first enter you get to see a little movie (Disc 5).

      1st floor:  A fat merchant will come up to you and say that there is
                  madness inside.  Well we knew that.  There is a lone guard at
                  (x 731 y 493).  You can tell him that you are seeking
                  employment or can beat him up.  Your choice.

      Basement:   You'll find a lone guard here and some treasures at (x 147
                  y 328) and (x 182 y 218).  There is an exit that leads to the
                  sewers here at (x 678 y 526).

      2nd floor:  Here you'll encounter another guard named Dra'tan.  Either
                  tell him that you're delivering a message to Sarevok, and
                  that you'll pass his comments on or fight him (if so, he'll
                  summon two other guards to help him out).  There is some
                  guards on this level (they all have minor treasures).

      3rd floor:  Another guard will accost you here.  Again pass yourself off
                  as new recruits who don't yet have their uniforms.  Also on
                  the third level, Nortuary will come up and talk to you.  He
                  wants to know where the Iron Throne higher ups are.  Tell him
                  that they are upstairs.  An Emissary from the Grand Dukes
                  named Tar will initiate a conversation with you.  Do not kill
                  her or you'll lose reputation.

      4th floor:  Do not kill anyone on this floor or you'll lose a lot of
                  reputation points.  You can impersonate the Emisary Tar when
                  talking to Destus Gurn to get some free information.  There
                  are some scrolls at (x 1136 y 508) and (x 877 y 412).

      5th floor:  A really big fight will ensue from your entrance on this
                  floor with several tough Iron Throne leaders.  I'd recommend
                  using a Fireball or three, and/or a Cloudkill.  You can also
                  use Dire Charm on some of them to get some free added
                  firepower.  Beyond that, good luck.  Don't forget to search
                  everywhere for letters, treasures, etc...  You'll also
                  discover what happened to Emissary Tar here.  I didn't keep
                  track of which treasures belong to which person, but here's a
                  list of treasures you'll get:  Ring of Free Action, Wand of
                  Lightning, Halberd +2, Bracers AC 7, 7 Spells, Mace +1, Wand
                  of the Heavens, War Hammer +1.

                    MartectX has this battle strategy to add:

                      First have your thief hide in shadows and go up. Go
                      to Thaldorn and talk to him - because now unintentional
                      killing of the Emissary isn't too bad. You could also
                      charm Thaldorn later and force-talk to him. Now go up
                      with your highest-hitpoints character (should be your
                      fighter) and the one or two mages that you are instantly
                      visible to should start casting a spell.

                      Quickly (!) go down the stairs and go back up
                      immediately. Again he/they will start casting a spell.
                      Down again. Repeat until all visible mages come towards
                      you. DON'T WALK UP TO THEM! At this point you'll probably
                      want to shoot one or two arrows at them, don't you? When
                      they reach you they'll begin casting again - get out NOW!
                      Repeat until they are out of spells - behead them!

                      Now the more complicated part: Quicksave first, go 2
                      meters to the middle of the room - Cloudwulfe should
                      begin shooting you (not to be prevented) - go on until
                      the last mage starts casting. NOW RUN BACK! You should
                      make it down with those magic arrows being 2-3 meters
                      away. Poohhhhhhh. Quicksave? Repeat this process. This
                      has two advantages: Cloudwulfe gets out of arrows (or he
                      did in my case) the last mage becomes dog-biscuit. Get
                      your party up (or only the fighters and archers), beat
                      Cloudwulfe and his other fighting companion (I guess it's
                      Gardush or whomever).

                  And here's the Experience you get from it:
                  Zhalimar Cloudwulfe--3000 exp
                  Gardush--1800 exp
                  Alai--1800 exp
                  Naaman--2000 exp
                  Diyab--1600 exp
                  Aasim--1800 exp

    Once that's done find Thaldorn and threaten him until he tells you where
    the other leaders of the Iron Throne are. (Candlekeep)  And also gives you
    information on all their dirty deeds, which he claims Reiltar has.  Kill
    him if you want to get 975 exp, a Short Sword +1, and a Studded Leather +1.
    Iron Throne:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 400 y 600)

Subquests:
  - Ghorak the Diseased
    In a house near the south of the area you will find a diseased man who
    cannot be cured by conventional (and by that I mean magical) means.  There
    is, however, a way to cure him.  Simply go to the Three Old Kegs Inn, there
    you will find a Skull behind a painting on the second floor.  Take the
    Skull to Agnasia at the Lady's Hall.  She'll tell you a little story about
    the Skull's previous owner, and give you 1000 exp, and a Reputation +1.
    You can if you want, go talk to Ghorak again to see him cured, but you get
    nothing more.

  - Nadarin's Basilisk Part 2 (see the above sub section)

  - Noralee's Gauntlets
    In a warehouse to the south of the Basilisk warehouse you will find a
    female archer by the name of Noralee who has lost some Gauntlets.  She asks
    you to pick up the Gauntlets before someone else does.  Go pick up the
    gauntlets, and return them to her (they are Gauntlets of Weapon Skill) to
    get your reward: 1000 exp, 2 Potions, and a Reputation +1.  Or you could
    just keep them. (THAC0 +1)  Once you give them to her, she leaves, so
    decide if you want them before that!
    Noralee:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 3550 y 1520)
    Gauntlets:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 730 y 2700)

  - Cordyr's Sirines
    Cordyr has been having some trouble with Sirines far to the south.  If the
    party has a low or medium reputation, he'll ask them to get rid of them.
    Kill them to get a reward:  a Haste Scroll.  The Sirines he wants dead are
    in the Lighthouse Map (AR 3600) and you may have already killed them (one
    of them is named Sil).  See Flesh Golem Cave in Lighthouse Map (AR 3600)
    for more information.
    Sil and 2 sirines:  Lighthouse (AR 3600, x 383 y 1209)
    Cordyr:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 3060 y 875)

Other:
  - Desreta, Vay-ya and the Void
    A wench in the Low Lantern (a brothel if you must know) by the name of
    Desreta will come up to you on the second level, and blabber on about being
    "one with the void" and how life is meaningless.  Long story short, you
    have to fight her as well as her mage companion Vay-ya.
    Desreta--1200 exp, Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Long Sword +1, 172 gp
    Vay-ya--2000 exp, Wand of Fire, Dagger +1, 2 Spells, 2 Gems, 94 gp
    Low Lantern:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 3420 y 3090)

  - Yago
    Yago is on the third level of the Low Lantern, you can kill him if you
    want.  You get 1400 exp, a Knave's Robe, and Yago's Book of Curses.  You
    can search the chest near his bed for some good spells (like Fireball if
    you don't already have it) and some gold.  Yago's Book of Curses is
    important in a subquest in the NE Section (Brielbara and Yago's Book of
    Curses).
    Low Lantern:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 3420 y 3090)

  - Larriaz the Sirine
    Larriaz was abducted by a fisherman, and has now exacted her revenge by
    killing his entire family.  Kill her and you get 30 exp.  Whee.  You can
    then search the house for some more minor treasures.
    Larriaz:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 3970 y 1660)

  - Child's body from Umberlee's temple
    You can wander into Umberlee's temple and talk to the Bitch Queen's
    Priestess here (that's what Umberlee is known as).  Ask to talk to Tenya
    (she's the girl you helped retrieve that BOWL awhile back) and she will
    appear and give you a corpse.  This is to complete the subquest in the
    W Section of the city titled "Varci Roaringhorn and the High Price..."
    Temple:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 870 y 2340)

  - Ogre Mages
    In one of the buildings here you will find 4 Ogre Mages (this could have
    been listed as an Assassination attempt, except none of them have names)
    who want to kill you.  A fifth one is invisible and will become visible
    once he initiates a conversation with your party.
    Building:  Harbor (AR 1200, x 1140 y 1215)

15d. Baldur's Gate SW Section (AR 1100)                              [DBLDSW]

Companions:     S  D  C  I  W  Ch
  - Tiax        9  16 16 10 13 9        Gnome      Cleric/Thief    Chaotic Evil
    Tiax is a very bizarre fellow who believes that he will one day "ascend" to
    become the ruler of the Realms.  He thinks that that is his "destiny" as
    foretold to him by Cyric.
    Special Abilities:  Summon Ghast
    Where he is:  Baldur's Gate SW Section (AR 1100, x 1440 y 1610)

Enemies:  Dopplegangers, Green Slimes

Treasures:  Spear +1 (Seven Suns)
            Wand of Magic Missiles (Seven Suns)
            Medium Shield +1 (Duke Eltan's Office)
            Splint Mail +1 (Duke Eltan's Office)

Plot:
  - Go talk to Scar again in the Flaming Fist HQ, and he'll ask for you to
    investigate the Seven Suns.  This is done in two parts, freeing Jhasso, and
    killing the Dopplegangers, so be sure to get both rewards.  See The Seven
    Suns below for more info.

  - The Sewers
    Scar wants you to check the sewers of the city for a beast of some sort.
    Go to the eastern end of the city, and down into the sewers.  Then go to
    (AR 0226, x 1335 y 1590) and kill the Ogre Mage (Bastard Sword +1) and his
    Carrion Crawler buddies.  Take all the items from the Ogre Mages body, but
    don't sell them.  Go back to Scar and tell him what the Ogre Mage was doing
    down there, and then give the Ring to Scar for your reward:  3000 exp, and
    3000 gp.

  - Finally to finish Chapter 5 and leave Baldur's Gate talk to Scar again
    until he wants to talk to you about the Iron Throne.  Go outside and talk
    to him, and agree to meet with Duke Eltan.  Tell the Duke what you know (if
    you went into the Iron Throne's HQ tell him about Reiltar) and he'll
    transport you to Candlekeep to get information from the Throne.  If you
    haven't done the Iron Throne yet, you'll have to before you can leave!
    Also if you haven't done the Iron Throne yet, you can wander around Duke
    Eltan's office, and swipe his items.  On Duke himself you'll find the
    History of the Nether Scrolls, and in another room you'll find a Medium
    Shield +1 and a Splint Mail +1.

Subquests:
  - The Seven Suns
    When we first entered Baldur's Gate we were asked by Scar to investigate
    the Seven Suns merchant guild.  Now we have the opportunity to do just
    that.  Enter the building, and a merchant will talk to you.  Go downstairs
    (the stairs down are in the SW end of the room) to find a Doppleganger and
    the head of the guild, Jhasso.  Talk to him and say that you are there to
    rescue him.  He'll say that the guild was taken over by Dopplegangers.  You
    can search the basement for a Spear +1, a Wand of Magic Missiles, and other
    minor treasures.  Go back upstairs and talk to any merchant over and over
    until they crack and turn into Dopplegangers.  Kill all the ones here, then
    go upstairs and kill the two up there.  Once that is done go over to the
    Flaming Fist HQ, go inside and talk to Scar to get your reward: 9000 gp,
    4000 exp, and a Reputation +2. (MartectX mentions that dialog option 2
    leads to the good reward, option 3 leads to a much lesser reward) He'll
    also give you another job which is covered below.
    Seven Suns:  SW Section (AR 1100, x 3480 y 1240)
    Scar:  SW Section (AR 1100, x 1500 y 1300)

  - Fergus' Angel Skin Ring
    If you have an Angel Skin Ring handy (and you should by now), go to the
    Flaming Fist HQ and talk to Fergus (he's just down the hall past Scar).  He
    wants a ring for his special someone.  Talk to him again to give him the
    ring, and get your reward:  800 exp, and a Reputation +1.
    Fergus:  SW Section (AR 1100, x 1500 y 1300)

Other:
  - Green Slime Tavern
    There is a tavern that has been invaded by green slimes.  Go inside and
    kill the slimes.  However, whatever you do, several people will be killed
    (even if you kill all the slimes really quickly!).
    Tavern:  SW Section (AR 1100, x 2470 y 725)

  - Thieves Looting a House
    There are four members of the Shadow Thieves' Guild (Dirk, Sath, Meakin and
    Wiven) looting a house.  They all have minor treasures.
    Thieves:  SW Section (AR 1100, x 2250 y 1770).

  - Sunin the Mage
    When you break into Sunin's house (in the southern part of this area) he
    of course assumes that you are thieves, and will attack you.
    Sunin--2000 exp, Robe, Ring of Wizardry, 2 Spells, 102 gp
    Joular--1200 exp, Long Sword +1, 64gp
    Maka--1300 exp, Plate Mail, Magic Arrows, 39gp
    Sunin:  SW Section (AR 1100, x 1700 y 2500)

  - Phandalyn
    As you enter a tavern in the SW part of this area, a paladin by the name of
    Phandalyn will approach you.  If you have any Evil party members, he will
    attack.  However, he is still considered Non-Threatening (i.e. his circle
    is still blue) so if you attack and kill him, you still get the appropriate
    loss in reputation.  Sucks.
    Phandalyn:  SW Section (AR 1100, x 1100 y 2200)

Companions: none

Enemies: none

Treasures:  Necklace of Magic Missiles (Halruuan Skyship)
            Eagle Bow (Lothandar's Geas)
            Dagger +2 (Lothandar's Geas)
            Tome of Wisdom (Lothandar's Geas)

Plot:
  - Just some subquests to accomplish.  If you have a Thief be sure to pick up
    the Eagle Bow (Lothandar's Geas).

Subquests:
  - Ragefast's Nymph
    You will encounter a Lady Hannah here who complains about Ragefast the Mage
    who has enslaved a Nymph in the Western part of the city.  Check the
    Section titled Baldur's Gate W Section for information on completing this
    subquest.

    Hannah:  Central Section (AR 0700, x 330 y 870)
    Ragefast:  W Section (AR 0600, x 2875 y 475)

  - The Statues of Felonius Gist
    Do not free any of these statues until you talk to Degrodel in the NW
    Section!  Inside of Felonius' town house you will find a series of statues.
    Free the one in the North West corner and demand to know where the Helm of
    Balduran is (you get a small reward of 500 exp for freeing him).  He will
    give you a scroll that gives you a bit of a clue about it, saying that it
    is in an Inn.  You can free the others, but you don't get anything more.
    Town House:  Central Section (AR 0700, x 1750 y 1000)

    Note:  (from danecobain) If you free the guy in the corner and get the
           information from him then if you say that you want to fight him then
           you can kill him for some exp. Then all of the statues turn red and
           you can use the scrolls on them one at a time to get them to attack
           you one at a time and kill them all. Doing this I got 5800 xp, a
           load of arrows, 2 healing potions and a mage robe of electric
           resistance with no reputation loss.

  - Lothandar's Geas
    When you wander around the Tents in this area you will be confronted by
    Lothandar (again if you talked to him in the NE Section) who tells you that
    you have been poisoned in your sleep.  If you help him remove a Geas from
    himself, he'll help you get rid of the poison.  Sounds good enough.  He
    takes you to see a Diviner, ask the Diviner how to help Lothandar and he
    directs you to the Temple of Umberlee.  Go to the temple and ask to see the
    High Priestess (you'll have to bribe them).  Talk to her and ask for help
    to remove the Geas and she'll ask for you to get a Book from the Temple of
    Tymora.  Wander over to the West section of the city and into the Lady's
    House (the Temple of Tymora), there ask the priest there for the book, and
    say that you'll die if you don't get it.  He decides that that is a worthy
    enough cause, and gives you the Book of Wisdom.

    Now go back to the Temple of Umberlee and give the Priestess the book (say
    that you don't trust her to get the Scroll of Remove Geas before handing
    her the book).  Now go to the Blade and Stars Inn to find Lothandar to give
    him the Scroll.  He will give you his HALF of the antidote (as well as 1500
    exp) and tell you to get the second half from Marek in the Blushing Mermaid
    Inn.  You'll find Marek on the Second Level of that Inn, and he will fight
    you instead of just giving it to you.  You get 10000 experience for curing
    the poison.
    Marek--650 exp, Eagle Bow, Dagger +2, 3 Potions, 200 gp
    Lothandar:  Central Section (AR 0700, x 2650 y 1120)
    Diviner:  Central Section (AR 0700, x 2500 y 800)

    Blushing Mermaid Inn:  NE Section (AR 0300, x 200 y 1725)

      Dark Angel (dkangel@dsuper.net) had an alternate way to complete
      Lothandar's Geas:

        In the section 15.e (Baldur's Gate Central Section) who wrote how to
        complete the subquests Lothandar's Geas. You described how to acquire
        to book of wisdom to the high priestess of The Bitch Queen.  I thought
        that letting her have this valuable tome (which raises wisdom by 1
        point) was somehow deceiving.  So after telling her that I did not
        trust her and receiving the scroll, I told her that I did not had the
        book.  Because of that she decide to attack me.  After killing her and
        all of her priestess (the normal priestess only attack after you kill
        the high priestess, and doesn't cast spells), nothing happened.  No
        reputation losses, no becoming a fallen paladin (I'm a paladin with a
        reputation of 20), nothing.  So I decided to keep that game.  The best
        part of it was that killing the high priestess gave me 6000 exp
        points, and if you haven't done the "Varci Roaringhorn and the High
        Price of Umberlee" subquest, well there a body of a young child on her
        (which was a strange thing for my game because I had already done it).

  - Nadine's Son
    Nadine's Son has wandered off again to one of Baldur's Gate's many taverns.
    She wants you to give him a good luck talisman, an Amulet +1.  You'll find
    Euric (her son) in the SE Section.  He says that the Amulet looks funny,
    but he isn't coming home.  For your trouble you get 1100 exp.  (thanks to
    Stephen Ashton for the solution to this one)  Go back to Nadine and talk to
    her to get a Necklace of Missiles and a Reputation + 1 (thanks to Andrey
    Moujikov for that).

  - Oberan's Estate
    In a house in the northern part of this area are several components which
    are required to create a Halruuan Skyship, a Gem, a Statue and a Book.  Go
    inside the house, you can claim to be a servant (if you aren't "well armed"
    at the time!), but it isn't necessary.  Go up to the third floor, and kill
    the three guards there.  Then search the desk to find the three things.
    Whatever you do, don't attack the servant!  Even if he turns red!

  - Dabron Sashenstar
    He is the cousin of Aldeth Sashenstar and will only appear if you've killed
    Aldeth in the first Cloakwood Forest.  As you might have guessed, he
    doesn't like you so be prepared for a fight.  He has a magical heavy
    crossbow on him and some other treasures.

Subquests:
  - Varci Roaringhorn and the High Price of Umberlee
    Just north of the Lady's House you will encounter a runt named Varci who
    needs your help with something.  Agree to help and he'll take you into a
    house.  Go into the house and a priest of Tymora will explain that a child
    and Varci wandered into the Umberlee temple with mischief on their minds,
    and for that one of them was killed.  He wants you to go to the Temple and
    retrieve the body so that he can revive him.  Go to the Harbor, and into
    the temple.  Ask to talk to Tenya (the girl you retrieved the Elemental
    Bowl for) and she'll give you the body.  Return with the body, and give it
    to the priest.  He will walk a little ways away, talk to him again and
    he'll revive his son.  They argue a bit, and leave.  Talk to Varci to get
    your reward:  5000 exp, 2000 gp, Large Shield +1 +4 vs. Missiles.

  - Ragefast's Nymph
    Ragefast the great Mage has taken a Nymph captive and it's your job to free
    her.  Go into his house in the northern part of this area, and talk to him.
    Be firm that she must be free, but don't threaten him.  You can talk him
    into letting her go, and if you do you get a reward:  2000 exp, and Nymph
    Hair.

    What does one do with Nymph's hair?  Matt Canfield sent me this:

      I discovered that if you talk to Halbazzer Drin in the Sorcerious
      Sundries, he offers to purchase the Nymph Hair from you for 500 gp.  If
      you decline and say it is too precious and you will not part with it he
      offers to weave a Nymph Cloak for you for an extra 100 gp, which is a
      total of 600 gp.  Agree to this and he gives you the Nymph Cloak, he
      already has one made.  This cloak is identical to Algernon's Cloak and
      gives you a Charisma +2 bonus.

Other:
  - Fenten's Ankhegs
    Fenten, the Dwarf, wants to buy Ankheg Shells from you.  He will buy every
    shell you have for 250 gp, and there's no limit to how many times you can
    do this.  So to maximize your profits, place all but one shell on the
    ground, and then talk to him.  (To get to Fenten go north from the SW
    Section)

  - Brathlen's Tour of the Hall of Wonders
    Talk to Brathlen just inside the Hall of Wonders to get a tour of the
    place.  He'll walk to a place, and stop.  There you talk to him again to
    learn more about whatever it is that you are looking at.

  - The Lousy Bard
    In the Temple of Gond (aka the High Hall of Wonders) you will find a bard
    who wants to buy stories off of you.  But when you tell one to him, he
    isn't satisfied and leaves.

    When you first enter the NW Area in Baldur's Gate Eldoth (if he is with
    you) will offer to take you up to Skie's father's estate.  Go inside the
    estate and you will find Skie.  She will only join you if Eldoth is with
    you, otherwise she thinks that you are thieves come to kill her.
    Where she is:  NW Section (AR 0100, x 1170 y 1625)

Enemies: Battle Horrors, Doom Guards, Invisible Stalkers, Helmed Horrors

Treasures:  Helm of Balduran  (Degrodel and the Helm of Balduran)
            Battle Axe +2 ¯¯|
            Bracers AC 7    |—— The Maulers and the Gorpel Hind
            Long Sword +1 __|

Plot:
  - Definately pick up the Helm of Balduran (you don't really need to do the
    whole Degrodel subquest, just go into the Helm and Cloak Inn and get it).

Subquests:
  - Degrodel and the Helm of Balduran
    In Degrodel's House in the southern part of this area you will have to
    fight a lot of really tough monsters.  Battle Horrors, Invisible Stalkers,
    and Doom Guards.  Once past those, talk to Degrodel and he'll offer you a
    job, take the job and he'll explain that 6 people were turned to stone by
    Ragefast, and then sold to an art dealer.  One of those people had the Helm
    of Balduran on him, and Degrodel wants you to retrieve it.  To accomplish
    this he gives you 6 scrolls of Stone to Flesh.  Go to the Central Section,
    and into the house of Felonius Gist.  You'll see the statues in the north
    end of the room.  Free the statue in the corner and demand the Helm of
    Balduran from him.  He'll say that he doesn't have it, press further and
    he will give you a Scroll with a clue on it.  In case you haven't guessed
    it we're going to the Helm and Cloak Inn in the NW Section.  Go inside, and
    then go up the stairs in the back of the inn.  Find the painting in this
    room and search it to find the Helm.  Careful 'tis trapped!  If you give it
    to Degrodel he'll give you 5000 gp, but then have 3 monsters attack you and
    leave with the Helm.  It's much more worth it to keep the Helm.  What I did
    was I gave him the Helm, then killed him and took the Helm back.
    Degrodel:  NW Section (AR 0100, x 2100 y 3000)
    Statues:  Central Section (AR 0700, x 1750 y 1000)
    Helm and Cloak:  NW Section (AR 0100, x 3550 y 2900)

    Scott Werner had this to add:

      I already had the Helm of Balduran when I finally did this quest.  When
      I talked to the guy who used to be a statue about the helm, I told him
      about Degrodel's plan and said that I didn't need the helm.  For my
      honesty he said that I should go see his lover Quenash in the
      Undercellar and ask her for the Cloak of Balduran.  If for some odd
      reason you happen to notice that her lover is an elf with blonde hair (I
      had to reload a few times to get the answer right) she will give you the
      Cloak.

  - Quinn and Nester's Dagger
    Enter Quinn's house and he'll bug you to go check the Baldur's Gate Bridge
    area for signs of Nester who was attacked by an Ankheg.  Go there, and to
    the north of Tenya's cottage you will find an Ankheg, kill it and take the
    dagger from its body.  Take the dagger back to Quinn for your reward:  950
    exp, a Shandon Gem, and a Reputation +1.
    Quinn:  NW Section (AR 0100, x 3676 y 2225)
    Ankheg:  Baldur's Gate Bridge (x 4070 y 100)

  - The Twin's Boogeyman
    There is a "Boogeyman" peeping on a pair of twins near the center of this
    area.  Talk to one of the girls, and she'll say that they're being peeped
    upon.  Then a mage named Gervasse will enter and tell you that a Druid
    called Voltine is to blame for this.  Seems she is polymorphing into
    something unpleasant.  Well Voltine will appear in the room, go talk to
    her, and she says that Gervasse is to blame.  Interesting.  Go kill
    Gervasse (900 exp, Robe, 72gp) and then report to Voltine.  She'll give you
    a Wand of Polymorph for your trouble.  Go talk to one of the twins to get a
    Scroll (protection from evil) and 1000 exp.
    Twins:  NW Section (AR 0100, x 2770 y 2270)

  - Wanted: Algernon's Cloak
    A Dwarf named Pheirkas has need of Algernon's Cloak, so long as you don't
    kill Algernon.  Go to the Feldepost's Inn and filch it off of him (if you
    haven't already), and bring it back for a reward:  300 exp, and 200 gp.
    Pheirkas:  NW Section (AR 0100, x  y )
    Feldepost's Inn:  Beregost (x 1406 y 2640)

Other:
  - The Maulers and the Gorpel Hind
    In the Helm and Cloak Inn you will find four Adventurer's from the Gorpel
    Hind at the bar.  Talk to the second from bottom person and tell him your
    adventures from the Cloakwood forest and Mines.  Now go back to the
    entrance of the Inn and you will be accosted by Gretek and the Maulers.
    You aren't going to take that are you?  A big fight breaks out, and the
    Gorpel Hind will help you fight off the Maulers--although they aren't all
    that helpful!  If you really want their help, lead the Maulers up towards
    the bar.
    Gretek--1200 exp, Battle Axe +2, Plate Mail, 86gp
    Caturak--750 exp, Composite Long Bow, Arrows, 25gp
    Wilf--800 exp, Minor Treasures
    Nader--750 exp, Magic Arrows, Minor Treasures
    Arlin--850 exp, Adventurer's Robe, Gem, 38 gp
    Pargus--900 exp, Bracers AC 7, Long Sword +1, Gem, 48 gp
    Helm and Cloak:  NW Section (AR 0100, x 3550 y 2900)

    Scott Slonaker adds this:

      When you go to that bar and talk with Gorpel Hind, Gretek and his buddies
      show up and start a fight.  They have pretty decent treasure.  But what
      I've discovered (and this has been done several times) is that you can
      talk to Gorpel another time, immediately after the first and ANOTHER
      Gretek and Co. shows up!  You can then waste all of 'em for double
      experience and double treasure.  You have to be careful if you're going
      to use Fireball or something similar to get the extras, though, as some
      of the time I also knocked off the waiter hanging around, and lost half
      of my 20 reputation.  (Of course, with the cash you get, getting back to
      18 isn't too tough.)  And a couple of Gretek's buddies (specifically, the
      archer with the mean arrows) can get deceptively tough when they're
      twins.  Be sure to position your guys ahead of time.

15h. Baldur's Gate N Section (AR 0200)                               [HBLDNS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Mustard Jellies, Ghasts, Hobgoblin Elites, Kobold Commandos,

Treasures:  Cloak of Protection +1 (Petrine's Cat Angel)
            Helm of Glory (Jardak's House)
            Long Sword +1 (Jardak's House)
            Amulet of Metaspell Influence (Ramazith)
            Ring of Protection +2 (Ramazith)
            Tome of Clear Thought, INT +1 (Ramazith's Tower)

Plot:
  - Lots of good items to pick up here.

Subquests:
  - Petrine's Cat Angel
    Petrine has run away, and the only thing she misses from her old way of
    life is her cat angel.  Go into the house that she's standing by (do not
    listen to Bheren when he says he wants you to kill the cat!  You can pick
    his pocket to get a Cloak of Protection +1 as well), go upstairs.  Search
    the drawer to find an Angel Skin Ring.  Take this to Petrine.  For your
    trouble you get 500 exp.
    Petrine:  N Section (AR 0200, x 660 y 2775)

  - Rinnie's Book
    Rinnie wants you to pick up a Book for her so that she can have a more
    reliable source of information than mere hearsay.  If you have a History of
    Unicorn Run, give it to her. (it's BOOK55 if you just want to cheat it)
    Your reward:  900 exp, and a Protection from Poison Scroll.  You can find
    the book in Ramazith's tower at the top level.
    Rinnie:  N Section (AR 0200, x 1200 y 2800)

  - Ramazith and Ragefast's Nymph
    Just in front of the Giant Pagoda tower you will be propositioned (not THAT
    way!) by a Mage to fetch him a Nymph (ok, maybe it IS that way!) from
    another Mage, Ragefast.  Go to the W Section of the City and into
    Ragefast's home.  Talk to Ragefast, and he isn't about to hand the Nymph
    over, so you'll have to kill him (2000 exp, Amulet +1, Knave's Robe, Wand
    of Paralyzation), and take her yourself.  (or you could free her yourself
    and get 2000 exp and Nymph's Hair)  Take her back to Ramazith.  Now here's
    what I would do here.  Give her to Ramazith, then kill him and free her.
    Ramazith--400 exp, Amulet of Metaspell Influence, Ring of Protection +2.
    If you had freed the Nymph before this, just kill Ramazith and take his
    nice treasures.

      Jesse LaCroix sent me this:

        For some reason, when I returned the nypmh to Ramazith, he rewarded me
        with nothing.  No treasure or XP.  After you retrieve the Nymph for
        him, instead of killing him immedietely for 400 (four hundred) XP,
        lounge around in his entry room for a bit, and he will become angry and
        demand that you leave.

        If you try to talk to him first, you won't get the desired response, so
        let him talk to you.   Say something to piss him off, and he will fling
        a lightning bolt (I let him hit my lead character wearing boots of
        grounding and the Helmet of Defense which offers 20% Elec resistance.)
        and teleport to the top of the tower and say something to the effect of
        "find me in the top of the tower if you dare."  Each level sports a
        small troop of monsters.  The first one is the toughest (nasty Mustard
        Jellies) and the rest are relatively mediocre... Ghasts, Archer
        Hobgoblins, and Elite Kobolds.  Finally at the top is Ramazith.  Easily
        dispatched, killing him THIS way gives you 4000 (four thousand) XP.

        The Nymph can then be rescured for the normal 2000 xp and lock of hair
        before or after you go to the top of the tower.  Killing all the
        monsters on the way up also provides a moderate bit of treasure and
        some good XP, and I even found an Angel Skin Ring on one of the Ghasts
        so I don't have to go and buy one for that Flaming Fist guy.

    Ragefast:  W Section (AR 0600, x 2875 y 475)

  - The Noblewoman and Cyrdemac
    On the third floor of the Three Kegs Inn you will find a Noblewoman who
    wants you to find and kill Cyrdemac in an Elfsong Tavern.  He has been
    spreading "rumors" about her.  She offers you 2000 gp as an incentive.
    Return when he's dead and she'll pay you only 500 gold.  You could
    blackmail her, then return in 2 days for another 500 gold.  Now if you
    return a few days later and she'll have hired someone to kill you.  Oh
    dear.

    Interestingly, if you search her floor for treasure (most of it minor
    stuff) you'll find a cabinet with 208 Ziose Gems. (Lucky Dog)

    TRICK:  (from Thomas de Roode)  In the city of Baldur's Gate, there is an
            Inn at the north section, called the Three Old Kegs. On the upper
            floor of the Inn, there is a Noblewoman who wants you to get rid of
            some guy Cyrdemac in the Elfsong Tavern. Instead of doing that,
            charm the Noblewoman. Talk to her again, and she'll give you 500 gp
            for your trouble. Talk to her over and over and over again, and
            every time you get 500 gp from her! There's no limit in this I
            think! So now you can get rich without cheating.

    Noblewoman:  N Section (AR 0200, x 3700 y 2370)
    Cyrdemac:  Baldur's Gate (AR , x  y )

Other:
  - Jardak's House
    When you enter Jardak's house his butler (Drelik) will assume that you are
    Thieves (which you probably are) and will attack you (1200 exp, Short
    Sword +1).  Go upstairs and you'll find Jardak himself, and he'll attack
    you as well.  (3600 exp, Helm of Glory, Long Sword +1, etc.)
    Jardak:  N Section (AR 0200, x 2450 y 1230)

  - Ramazith's Tower
    Climb Ramazith's Tower and you will encounter different enemies on each
    level.  On the first level Mustard Jellies, second Ghasts, third Hobgoblin
    Elites, fourth Kobold Commandos.  On the top level you find a library.
    There are bunches of History Books here, 4 Spells, a Tome of Clear Thought
    (which raises your stats by INT +1), a Wand of Paralyzation, 400gp, and
    a Potion.

    Tip: You can pickpocket Ramazith to get a Ring of Protection+2 and Amulet
         of Metaspell Influence. Then if you end out killing him, you get those
         items again. (Yamian)

15i. Sewers Beneath Baldur's Gate (AR 0224, AR 0225, and AR 0226)    [ISWRSB]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions:  none

Enemies:  Phase Spiders, Ghasts, Kobold Commandos, Mustard Jellies, Carrion
          Crawlers

Treasures:  Bastard Sword +1 (See The Sewers, Baldur's Gate SW Section)

Plot:
  - We're here to finish the subquest that Scar gave us (The Sewers, Baldur's
    Gate SW Section).

  - Once in Chapter 7, you can use the sewers to get from one point in the city
    to another in order to avoid the Flaming Fist Soldiers that will be
    patrolling for you.  Personnally, I think it is easier to simply run away
    from the Flaming Fist Soldiers that'll see you and not use the sewers at
    all.  The enemies keeps respawning here so you could waste a lot of
    valuable ammunition on them.

AR 0224:

  - You'll find Schlumpsha The Sewer King here.  He and his goons have standard
    treasures.  You can also choose to fighting them or not (depending on how
    you answer with them).
    Schlumpsha The Sewer King and friends:  Sewers (AR 0224, x 2236 y 2063)

  - Exit to Undercellar

    Exit to basement of the Iron Throne Tower:  Sewers (AR 0224, x 66 y 417)

  - All other exits either lead out to the streets or to Sewers AR 0225.


AR 0225:

  - You'll find the arrogant Kobold Commando named Ratchild here.  Ratchild has
    killed some people so do the same to him.  Be advised that once attacked,
    he'll summons his clan (some Kobolds Commandos) to assist him.  They'll all
    appear in the adjacent tunnels so if your party is in the middle of the
    room (near Ratchild), they will get pelted from every side.  The
    recommended tactic is to send your best (and most padded) fighter to
    initiate the conversation while the rest of your party hangs back in one of
    the tunnels.  When the fight begins, almost all of the summoned Kobold
    Commandos will attack your fighter (since they won't have a line of sight
    with the rest of your party.  Take out Ratchild quickly since although he's
    just a Kobold Commando, he can cast spells.  They all have standard Kobold
    Commandos treasures.
    Ratchild:  Sewers (AR 0225, x 2304 y 2090)

  - Exit to Undercellar
    Exit to Undercellar:  Sewers (AR 0225, x 2182 y 3243)

  - All other exits lead out to the streets, to Sewers AR 0224 (exits on the
    left hand side of the map) or to Sewers AR 0226 (exits on the right hand
    side of the map).

AR 0226:

  - You'll find an Ogre Mage here (see subquest The Sewers, Baldur's Gate SW
    Section) with some Carrion Crawlers around him (his pets).
    Ogre Mage:  Sewers (AR 0226, x 1354 y 1587)

16. Candlekeep Revisited (AR 2626)                                   [16CNDL]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companions: none

Enemies: Dopplegangers, Greater Dopplegangers

Treasures:  Ring of Protection +1 (Koveras)

Plot:
  - We're here to search for the leaders of the Iron Throne.

  - Make your way to the Central Keep (I would go to the Inn first, and sleep
    until you gain your new special ability first) and go inside.  You get to
    watch a little movie (which is quite inconveniently placed on Disc 2) and
    then you're inside.  Almost immediately Karan your old tutor will come up
    and talk to you.  You can trust him.  He has some things to say about this
    new person Koveras, who apparantly knows the prophecies of Alaundo by
    heart.

  - On the second level you will encounter Koveras who wants to give you a Ring
    of Protection +1, it doesn't matter if you take it in the end, although it
    will change what happens slightly.  Also on the second level is Chanter
    who will tell you about the Catacombs under Candlekeep.

  - On the Third level you can find the Leaders of the Iron Throne, and if you
    didn't take the Ring, Koveras told you to kill them.

  - On the Fourth Level you will find Shistal, and although he looks like a
    Monk he is really a Greater Doppleganger.  Keep on harassing him until he
    gives up the charade.

  - On the Fifth Level we can find Gorion's Old Room (x 665 y 1000) and a
    letter that explains once and for all who you are.  You are the "spawn of
    bhaal" one of the "Dead Three" (if you bothered to read that book).  As
    such you are special, and therefore everyone (most especially Sarevok and
    later Joneleth Irenicus) wants to use you for their own purposes.

  - On the Sixth Level you will be arrested for killing the leaders of the Iron
    Throne whether you did it or not. (so you may as well do it before coming
    up to this level, hey if you're going to do the time anyway... may as well
    do the crime!)  Let him arrest you and take you to their prison.  Ulraunt
    will visit you, but has nothing nice to say.  Then Tethtoril will appear,
    ask him about Koveras and he'll say that Koveras is Sarevok backwards.
    Take him up on his offer of teleportation to get to the Candlekeep
    Catacombs.

Subquests: none

Other:
  - The Priest of Oghma
    If you want a taste of things to come, go into the priest's house (it's
    where we were attacked back in the Prologue) and bother the priest a lot
    about what he is doing to the cat (he says he is studying it, but I suspect
    that he was going to eat it), he will turn into a Doppleganger and attack
    you.
    Priest's House:  Candlekeep (x 2970 y 425)

  - Parda
    You can find Parda in the Bunkhouse, but he isn't a Doppleganger.  He tells
    you that he feels something foul afoot, and although we already knew that,
    it shows that not everyone is a complete fool missing the evil right under
    their noses.
    Bunkhouse:  Candlekeep (x 2870 y 2650)

  - Cadderly
    An old friend of Gorion is near the entrance to the central library.  You
    can reminisce about old times if you want.
    Cadderly:  Candlekeep (x 3100 y 2070)

  - Star Sapphire (from Silviu)
    On the second floor of the Candlekeep Inn, there is a lock that is very
    hard to pick.  You'll probably not be able to open it in the Prologue but
    when you come back in chapter 6, you'll be able to do so.  Inside there is
    a Star Saphire (worth 1000 Gp).

            Manual of Gainful Exercise STR +1
            War Hammer +1
            Wand of Fire

Plot:
  - You'll appear in a small room, search the bookshelves for spells, then
    leave the room to enter the Catacombs proper.  All treasures in the
    Catacombs are going to be placed in Other, so you may want to go through
    those before you leave the Catacombs.  Oh and there are lots of traps, so
    be careful.

  - Go down the hall to (x 3400 y 1250) where you will be attacked by the
    Phlydia Doppleganger.  The NW and SW passages lead to various treasures,
    the way out is to the NE.

Plot:
  - Almost immediately you will be attacked by the Dreppin Doppleganger.  You

    Now I bet you're thinking that they are Dopplegangers.  Well you are right.

    and attack you.

18. Baldur's Gate Revisited                                          [18BLDG]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Remember to rest in an Inn to get your Special Ability for this chapter.
      Also try to avoid the Flaming Fist as they don't like you anymore.
      After all you did for them.

Note: If you get arrested by the Fist, talk to Neb to get yourself released.
      The answer to his sequence thing is 33.

Note: If you get caught by flaming fist but you have Shar-Teel in your group,
      then Angelo will release you. Why? It seems that Shar-Teel is the
      daughter of Angelo!  (from Jones)

Enemies: Flaming Fist

Treasures:  Short Sword of Backstabbing +3 (Slythe)
            Dagger +2 Longtooth (Krystin)
            Sling +1 (Krystin)

Plot:
  - After doing the Full Plate +1 quest (see below) go to the Harbor at
    Baldur's Gate and a peasant will talk to you, mentioning that Sarevok is
    about to become the Grand Duke.  Goodie.

  - Enter the Iron Throne compound, and you'll find Dhanial trying to flee.
    Talk to her and pump her for information on Sarevok's plans.  A little
    further in you'll find Pang who has a little more info on Sarevok.  Go
    upstairs to find yet another dispirited Iron Throne goon, Gregor.  He may
    attack you if you answer him wrong (650 exp, Short Sword +1, 150 gp).  Also
    Tralithan can be found on this level, and yes he has more information on
    Sarevok.  Go upstairs again and talk to Kalessia, who is from the main
    branch of the Iron Throne.  Go upstairs again and talk to Wirthing here.

  - Go up to the last level and talk to Cythandria, and you'll have to fight
    her and two Ogres.  Make sure to get the Diary of Sarevok off her body.
    She also has two letters on her from the assassins of the Grand Dukes.
    Cynthandria--2000 exp, 144gp

  - Go to the N Section of the City and a Flaming Fist named Sorrel will talk
    to you telling you that Angelo is taking over the Flaming Fist, and that
    Duke Eltan has taken sick.  Find a Flaming Fist and get yourself arrested
    (it's faster this way).  You'll be confronted by Angelo in the Flaming Fist
    HQ, and he will reveal that he is under the employ of Sarevok, although
    that hardly seems to matter now.  He may kill one of your party.  You will
    be stuffed into a jail cell.  Talk to Neb a few times until he offers to
    get you out of jail, the answer to his sequence is 33.

  - Go back into the Fist HQ, and go up the stairs (you can fight the battle on
    the main floor if you want, or can't get past it).  Talk to Kent here, who
    says that the healer working on Eltan isn't all that he seems.  Go into the
    next room and talk to the healer, and accuse him of ... whatever.  He'll
    turn into a Greater Doppleganger and attack you.  Talk to Eltan and he'll
    ask to be taken to the Harbormaster's House to recover, and he'll also give
    you a letter and a charge, to find the Assassins Slythe and Kristin before
    they can kill the last two Dukes.

  - Take Eltan to the Harbormaster (x 2650 y 1835) and you'll get 2500 exp.

  - Go back to the Iron Throne building, go inside, and go down into the
    basement.  (The stairs down are in the SE corner of the main floor)
    Dispatch the guard, and search for the door to the sewers.  Now go out the
    exit at (AR 0224, x 100 y 800) to get to the Undercellars.  Walk down into
    the place a bit until you bump into the two assassins.  They'll talk
    amongst themselves for a bit then attack you.  Kill them and take the
    scrolls from off of Slythe, one of them is an Invitation to Sarevok's
    Coronation.  Slythe--5000 exp, Short Sword of Backstabbing +3, Minor
    Treasures Krystin--3000 exp, 7 Spells, Magic Bullets, Dagger +2 Longtooth,
    Sling +1

    Another way into the Undercellar is to go through the back door in the
    Blushing Mermaid. (If you missed the Cloak of Balduran the first time
    through the city, make sure to pick it up now, see NE Section above for
    more details.)

  - Go to the N Section of the city, and to the Ducal Palace (you can't miss
    it).  Talk to the guard there and show him the invitation.  Go inside.

Subquests:

  - The Full Plate +1 Quest (from Silviu)
    When you enter Baldur's Gate in Chapter 7, there is a nice quest that you
    can do and that leads eventually to the best armor in the game, the Full
    Plate Mail +1.  First, you'll have to find Tamoko (Sarevok's lover) near
    the center of this map, by the Sorcerous Sundries.  She will begin to talk
    to you and what is really important in this first encounter is that you
    tell her that you did NOT kill the Iron Throne leaders in Candlekeep,
    otherwise she won't continue the discussion.  After a few exchanges, she'll
    tell you to meet her in front of the Flaming Fist Castle in the SW part of
    the city.  Do so.  There, she'll tell you that Sarevok was not as lucky as
    you in life and that he had no one to guide him.  She'll tell you that he
    is not that evil after all and that Cythandria is the one that has a bad
    influence on him.  She will ask you to remove her and will make you promise
    that when the final battle comes, you will not kill Sarevok, as silly as it
    may seem.  Promise her that.  Then, do the rest of the quests in the city
    until you come in front of Sarevok's house in the Undercity.  There, you'll
    meet Tamoko again and she'll tell you that Sarevok's considers her as a
    traitor now and that she has to kill you to regain his confidence.  You can
    talk her out of it, but fighting her is ultimately the best (and most
    rewarding) solution.  Besides the Flail +1 and Large Shield +1, she also
    carries the very nice Full Plate Mail +1.

      Note: While the Full Plate +1 is the best armor, the best combination of
            armor and other items is the regular Full Plate and a the Ring or
            Cloak of Protection +2.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. Ducal Palace (AR 0108)                                           [19THDC]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first enter the palace you get to watch a little movie (Disc 5).

Plot:
  - Once inside they ask for your invitations again.

  - Go forward just a bit into the next room to watch the Coronation Ceremony.
    Things go well until Sarevok notices you, and then all the nobles turn back
    into Dopplegangers and attack you and the other two Dukes there.  Kill
    the Dopplegangers (don't let the Dukes get killed now!), and then show the
    Duke your evidence against Sarevok.  Sarevok gets mad and decides to
    attack.

  - Beat Sarevok up until he teleports away.  Belt will then Divine where he
    went and teleport you to the Thieves' Guild.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. On the Trail of Sarevok                                          [20NTHT]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enemies: Green Slimes, Ochre Jellies, Mustard Jellies, Grey Ooze, Doom Guards,
         Skeleton Warriors, Invisible Stalkers,

Plot:
  - You'll appear in the Thieves' Guild and they seem a bit put out by all the
    people teleporting into their location.  Ask where Sarevok went and they'll
    point you down the stairs at (x 1050 y 500).  He also mentions that you
    can buy supplies here if you need.

  - You'll find a wounded thief down here who can give you some information on
    what you're facing, the Thieves' Maze.

  - The Thieves' Maze is surprisingly straightforward with little challenge
    (besides the monsters and traps anyway).  Make your way through the maze
    and eventually you will end out at (x 550 y 1180) to talk to one of
    Sarevok's allies whom Sarevok has discarded.  Talk to him then go out the
    exit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. The Hidden City (AR 0123)                                        [21THHD]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first enter the Hidden City you will be treated to a movie (Disc
      5 still).

Enemies: Skeletons, Skeleton Warriors, Ghouls, Ghasts, Zombies, Battle Horrors

Plot:
  - Walk to the west a little bit until you are confronted by Rahvin of the
    Iron Throne.  Say what you will, he'll attack you anyway.
    Gorf--2000 exp, 2 Spells, Minor Treasures
    Haseo--1500 exp, Ring of Protection +1, Long Sword +1, 64gp
    Rahvin--1800 exp, Ring of Protection +1, Magic Arrows, 1 Spell
    Carston--2400 exp, Magic Arrows, Minor Treasures
    Wudei--1200 exp, Studded Leather +1, 14gp
    Shaldrissa--1200 exp, Robe, etc.

  - When you're ready go to the Big Building that is the only non-ruined
    structure here (x 1688 y 1327) and go inside.

  - Here you have to fight a really big (and final) battle.  You needn't kill
    the supporting goons if you don't want, you only have to get rid of
    Sarevok.

    Once that is done then you have won the game!

    Angelo--9800 exp, Long Bow +1, Magic Arrows, Wand of Lightning
    Tazok--4000 exp, Minor Treasures
    Semaj--3000 exp, Robe, 2 Spells, 85 gp

    Strategy on fighting Sarevok (from Dennis Matheson):

      While in Baldur's Gate I stocked up on as many Monster Summoning II
      scrolls and Potions of Explosions/Oils of Firey Burning as I could find.
      Then, in the final battle with Sarevok I did the following.

      I equipped my main character with Boots of Speed and gave him the
      potions/oils and the Necklace of Missiles.  He walked around the carving
      on the floor until I could just see the corner of the podium that Sarevok
      and his cronies are on. I then started tossing the potions and missiles
      at the podium.  I couldn't see any of them but they kept taking damage.
      It took a *lot* of potions but eventually I killed Angelo, Tazok and
      Semaj without them ever taking a single action against me.  (Apparently
      they just stood there wondering where the explosions were coming from
      until they died.)

      Then, I had Dynaheir cast Monster Summoning II where my main character
      was then had him step forward until Saverok saw him.  After the
      conversation exchange, I had everyone attack Saverok while my main
      character ran out of the way.  The summoned monsters kept Sarevok busy.
      The entire party kept attacking Sarevok with missiles except for Dynaheir
      who kept summoning monsters.  Sarevok died without a single member of my
      party taking a single hit.  I took zero damage in the entire final
      battle!


Congratulations on passing Baldur's Gate!

1. Ulgoth's Beard (AR 1000)                                          [1TSLGT]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: When you first arrive at Ulgoth's Beard a little text blurb appears in
      your window.

Companions: none

Enemies: none... yet

Plot:
  - Ulgoth's Beard is a good starting point for any adventure into the other
    areas in the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion.  Come here before tackling
    Durlag's Tower, for example.

Subquests:
  - Hurgan's Soultaker
    Inside the Ulgoth's Beard Inn is a Dwarf who has a bit of a mission for
    you.  He tells you the sad tale of the end of Durlag Trollkiller, and asks
    that you retrieve an item from the Tower of Durlag, a dagger called the
    Soultaker (which belonged to his grandda).  Agree to help him.  You'll find
    the Soultaker deep within Durlag's Tower.
    Hurgan: Ulgoth's Beard (x 2360 y 535)

  - Shandalar's Quest
    The Mage Shandalar asks that you perform a little retrieval operation for
    him.  Agree to it (if you don't want to be teleported there right now, ask
    for some time to prepare) and he will teleport you to a bizarre ice place.
    He wants you to pick up his cloak which is located somewhere in this
    dungeon.  But beware, there are a great many surly mages in here, who have
    apparantly been trapped here for years.  And they aren't too happy that you
    have a way out!  Check out the Ice Dungeon sub section below for more
    information on it.  Give him the cloak to get your reward: 500 exp.

    Tip: You can pickpocket some potions and spells off Shandalar. (Yamian)

    Or you can try to kill him...

    Shandalar: Ulgoth's Beard (x 1712 y 644)
    Cloak: Ice Dungeon (x 711 y 259)

  - Kill Shandalar!! (from Sir Erik Esoteric)
    After doing the Shandalra's Cloak quest in Ulgoth's Beard, I was quite
    annoyed that I only got 500xp for completing it. I decided reuniting
    him with his daughter's was the better option, and proceeded to attack
    him. I quickly learned that his spells could not be interrupted and
    after losing several times, decided on a new method. Casting haste and
    chant on my party and summoning Holy Might for my main character, I
    beefed up our protections a bit. I positioned my melee characters
    around him and kept my archers/spell casters in the distance (Shandalar
    loves to use lightning bolts). I force attacked him and had my mage begin
    pelting him with magic missiles. The first thing Shandalar will do is cast
    minor globe of invulnerability, but with your improved speed you can hit
    him with 3 sets of magic missiles (as well as any other damage) before the
    globe hits. As soon as the globe is up, cast dispel magic (which also
    eliminates the effects of his second spell, confusion). You will lose all
    of your protections (hence why you shouldn't cast more than the ones I
    listed) on your melee characters, but if your archers and spell casters are
    far enough away they should keep all of their enhancements. Shandalar will
    then target one character with lightning over and over again, so watch his
    health to make sure he doesn't die. The rest is just hacking him to death,
    and keep using magic missiles as Shandalar's protections are now gone.

    After this is all done, you will lose some reputation BUT you will get the
    robe of Neutral Archmagi, 2 potions of Heroism (ironically), many spells,
    and a whopping 26,000xp! By this point of the game, you should have plenty
    of gold to get your reputation back up. I figured it's a much better option
    than taking the 500xp he offers if you talk to him, and you get to keep his
    stupid cloak!

      Tip: Others have sent in their strategies for killing Shandalar as well.
           He sure is popular! They mostly involve using mass magic missiles
           before he gets his defenses up. Brad McClintock suggests using a
           Wand of Paralyzation before attacking.

  - Mendas' Quest
    Some time ago the Merchant's League in Baldur's Gate found a shipwreck
    believed to be that of Balduran himself.  Mendas would very much like to
    get his hands on Balduran's Logbook, but to do so he needs you to get the
    Charts from the Merchant's League's Counting House in Baldur's Gate.  Agree
    to help him.  You'll find the Counting House in the North East Section
    (AR 0300).  Unlock it and go inside.  If you want to get through this
    non-violently, tell the Guard that you are here to clear your debt, and
    that you have Tea and Spices from Kara-Tur.  Go upstairs and talk to the
    captain.  Ask him if there is anything that you can do for him, and he'll
    ask for the hardest liquor from Te'Tranion at the Blushing Mermaid.  Get it
    for him to get the Charts, or just steal them.  Return to Mendas and give
    him the charts.  He will give you 2000 gp, and tell you to meet him at his
    boat.  Go north and west up to the docks and talk to Mendas again, get on
    the ship and go.  You will shipwreck on Werewolves island.  (see that
    section below)
    Mendas: Ulgoth's Beard (x 850 y 1250)
    Charts: Baldur's Gate, North East Section (x 2350 y 3100)

  - Therella's Son Dalton
    Therella has a son who took to the life of adventuring and went to Durlag's
    Tower, and never returned.  His mother, Therella, asks that you find him
    and if possible return him.  After you've rescued Dalton, go back to
    Therella to get your reward: 300gp.  She'll also tell you that Dalton is
    out adventuring again.  Idiot.
    Therella: Ulgoth's Beard (x 1555 y 416)
    Dalton: Durlag's Tower, Underground, Level Six (x 1160 y 470)

  - Ike's Tours
    If you would like a tour of Durlag's Tower (which is completely
    unnecessary, you can go there on your own at any time) you can talk to Ike
    who will set up a tour for you.  It costs 60gp, and you have to get to the
    tower on your own.
    Ike: Ulgoth's Beard (x 2181 y 632)

Other:
  - Galken's Runestone
    Inside the Ulgoth's Beard Inn, near the Innkeeper you will find a commoner
    named Galken who will give you a Runestone if you pay his bar tab (900 gp).
    Agree to do so to get the Runestone.  He warns you that someone may be
    after that Rune (which he just may have stolen).   The Rune is important
    for Durlag's Tower.
    Galken: Ulgoth's Beard (x 2360 y 535)

  - Delsvirftanyon's Liquidation Sale
    Delsvirftanyon is selling off everything he has and for the low low price
    of only 500 measely gp you can have his entire inventory!  You mostly get
    some crap, but you do get one Dwarven Runestone (the other Rune he has is a
    forgery).
    Delsvirftanyon: Ulgoth's Beard (x 1573 y 1186)

  - Fenrus
    If you need more information on Durlag's Tower, you can come by the Docks
    and talk to Fenrus.
    Fenrus: Ulgoth's Beard (x 615 y 1322)

  - Dushai
    If you want more information on Balduran's Last Voyage, you can go talk to
    Dushai near the entrance to Ulgoth's Beard.  You will have to bribe her to
    get her to talk, though.  She will only talk to you AFTER you have already
    talked to Mendas.
    Dushai: Ulgoth's Beard (x 2443 y 811)

  - Ring of Free Action (from Master.SoR)
    If you pick pocket the meditating dwarf to the East of Shandalar she has
    a ring of free action!

2a. Durlag's Tower (interior, above ground)  (AR 0502)               [ATSDTI]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  Beware of traps while in the Tower!  It's safe to assume that every
       chest that you'll come across will be trapped, and that most passageways
       are as well.  Use your thief's Detect Trap skill wisely!  Also I suggest
       that you don't just use the Quick Save while in Durlag's Tower, have
       several backup saves ready just in case...

Walkthrough:
  Entry Level (AR 0502):  Not much to do here.  Ike is at (x 565 y 649) if you
            hired him.  Be advised that there is a trap at (x 473 y 356).
            There are two separate sets of stairs here.  The central stairs
            goes up and down, and the other set of stairs only goes up.  Go up
            either one.

              Note:  If you hired Ike, talk to him several times until you get
                     a conversation option.  Buy the token from him (doesn't
                     matter how much you pay, you'll get it back), and a Demon
                     will appear and start shooting Fireballs.

                     So it would be wise to talk to Ike with only ONE of your
                     party, have the others hide.  Then try to dodge the
                     fireballs.  Oh, and you can't kill the demon yet, so don't
                     bother trying.

  Second Level (AR 0503):  There are some minor treasures here, as well as some
            Ghasts and lots of traps.  Again there is more than one way to go
            up, pick one and go up the stairs.  The chest in the south room is
            trapped.  Also note that there is a way to the balcony outside at
            (x 1010 y 770).  If you want to go out there, be careful as there
            are a lot of Basilisks out there (1 Lesser Basilisk and 3 Greater
            Basilisks but they give good EXP, and there are some good items on
            the top balcony (see Other below) so...).

  Third Level (AR 0504):  Here you can talk to Riggilo (see the Nymph's Hair
            subquest below), a fellow adventurer, if a bit of a jerk.  You can
            also take the Southern Passage here to find a Ghost  (see Ghost
            down in the Other section).  Also don't forget to pick up the Tome
            of Understanding (x 1350 y 125) before going up to the next level.
            Be advised that this Tome is trapped by a Dire Charm Spell so send
            only one character to get the book and after, dispel the Dire Charm
            Spell (unless not charmed).  There are also two trap on this level
            which are at (x 479 y 786) and (x 1314 y 698).

  Fourth Level (AR 0505):  There are some good treasures here, as well as
            Kirinhale the Nymph (see Nymph's Hair in subquests, as well as
            Treasures in Other).  There is a trap at (x 1218 y 487).

Subquests:
  - Nymph's Hair -- Levels 3 and 4
    In the tower on level 3 you will come across a jerk named Riggilo.  Don't
    kill him.  On level 4, you'll find a Nymph named Kirinhale at
    (x 239 y 357), agree to help her out, and she gives you a lock of Nymph
    Hair.  Go back to Riggilo and give him the hair.  If he doesn't trust you,
    tell him that you don't want a "Dagger in my back", and he'll trade you a
    Potion of Storm Giant Strength for it.  Finally go back to the Nymph and
    get your reward: 4000 exp.  Also Riggilo is now trapped in the tower for
    eternity.  It's win-win!  If you want, go back and talk to Riggilo again,
    and he will get upset and attack you.  Kill him for 1400 more exp, and some
    minor treasures.

    A bizarre bug hit me here, each time I went to Level 4, it was like I had
    never been there before.  In other words, I could complete this subquest as
    many times as I liked!!  See the Strange Things section for more info on
    this and other bugs.  If you instead killed Kirinhale you get 3000 exp, a
    Staff Spear +2, and a Lock of Hair.
    Riggilo:  Durlag's Tower, Above Ground, Level 3 (AR 0504, x 1350 y 600)

2b. Durlag's Tower (interior, UnderGround) (AR 0511, 0512, 0513)     [BTSIND]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  To get underground, go back to the level where we entered the tower, and
       take the stairs that go down in the center of the chamber.  Beware of
       traps while down here!  It's safe to assume that every chest that you
       open is trapped, and that most passageways are trapped as well.  Use
       your thief's Detect Trap skill wisely!  Also I suggest that you don't
       just use the Quick Save while in Durlag's Tower, have several backup
       saves ready just in case...

            Large Shield +1 (Sixth Level on the Demonknight himself)

Walkthrough:
  Level 1 Underground (AR 0501):  Talk to Bayard here (x 637 y 520) to find out
            about the rest of Durlag's Tower.  If you came in search of Dalton
            (see Ulgoth's Beard above), then you can also ask him about that.
            When done, he'll vanish forever.  You can pick up some treasures
            here.  There are some traps here: (x 297 y 427) and (x 599 y 591)
            and 3 near (x 1174 y 393).  There is a secret door at (x 473
            y 158).

            When done, go through the secret passage at (x 470 y 160).

  Level 2 Underground (AR 0511):  There is a fireball trap just past the door
            here.  Lots of treasures here (magic arrows, money and others) and
            too numerous to give coordinates of each of them so be thorough.
            Go South and West until you reach the 4 Dwarf Warders near
            (x 2010 y 1150).  Talk to each of them.  They all have a little
            riddle for you to solve, and they aren't all that difficult, if you
            know what you are doing.  There are also quite a large number of
            trapped chests with various assortments of goodies here (like Magic
            Arrows, and Spells and such).  There is also a lot of hidden doors
            on this Level so keep your Thief's Detect Trap Skill on at all
            times.

             The Four Dwarven Warders Puzzle:
                 As you complete each puzzle (you'll know when you do),
                 you can go back to the Warder, and talk to the one that asked
                 the riddle you've just finished.  He'll then disappear and
                 you'll get 2000 exp (you'll get 2000 exp for each riddle you
                 complete).

                 Drop down to the round library (x 250 y 1500), and click on
                 all of the books.  After that is done, you will hear a click.
                 Go into the room across the hall to see Durlag's Pride (Sword)
                 at (x 1004 y 1417) being raised in Glory (or something like
                 that).

                 Wander over to the treasury, fight off its Skeletal Guardians
                 (x 1660 y 2100) and search the piles for a Big Blue Gem
                 (called a Glittering Beljuril Gemstone) and an Oddly Shaped
                 Key.  There are some other treasures here, like a Small
                 Shield +1.  Now go south west into the bed chamber, and open
                 up the chest at (x 1409 y 2260), which had been locked.  Open
                 the thing up and take the Switch for an Engine and whatever
                 treasures that you want.

                 Now go into the little closet (x 930 y 2200), and pick up the
                 Grapes, and any other treasures you want (Note:  don't forget
                 that other chest in the bedchamber! see Second Level Treasures
                 below for what's inside).

                 Go up a little ways into a room with a giant machine
                 (x 2095 y 1525), and go up the ramp on its side, and on the
                 wall use your new switch.  Now go up into the next room, and
                 use the Giant Wine Press (x 2869 y 1450) to make and fill a
                 bottle of Magic Wine (don't drink it).

                 Run up to well... another library (x 3400 y 850) and fight
                 your way through the Greater Dopplegangers.  On one of the
                 shelves you will find a Mallet Head.

                 Go back to the 4 Dwarf Warders, and in a barrel just
                 to the south west of them (x 1530 y 1235) you will find
                 the Mallet Handle.  Go up to the forge room (x 1628 y 222)
                 and use the Anvil there to repair the Mallet.  Now head
                 south and west to get to the Gong Room (x 403 y 1096).
                 Click on the Gong.

                 Go back and talk to the Dwarves, they will attack you,
                 and you must kill them.  Search their bodies to get a
                 Rune Stone to go to the next level.

                Use the Elevator thing to go to Level 3.

  Level 3 Underground (AR 0512):  This level is my least favorite of the whole
                Tower.  Ugh.  Lots of treasures here (magic arrows, money and
                others) and too numerous to give coordinates of each of them so
                be thorough.  There is also a lot of hidden doors, and traps,
                on this Level so keep your Thief's Detect Trap Skill on at all
                times.  Finally, if you attempt to rest, you'll be attacked by
                a Greater Doppleganger that takes the forms of Durlag, Islanne
                and Kiel.

                Go Southwest into the room with all the weird Gargoyle Statues,
                and two of them are Clickable.  By all means, click them (x 952
                y 1287) and (x 1075 y 1404).

                Now go back to the center, and from there go south and east
                into the bedroom, and take the Runes at (x 1675 y 1300),
                (x 1820 y 1080) and (x 1925 y 1170).  This causes Durlag to
                appear, he mutters some craziness, then turns into a Greater
                Doppleganger that you must destroy.

                Now go back out, and back to the Center.  Now the North West
                door is open.  Go up that way and whack the Sparring Dummies.
                When you do, Durlag appears again, and makes even less sense
                this time.  Again he turns into a Greater Doppleganger.

                Return to the Center again, and this time we can go North-East
                and into the Throne Room.  Go up and take the Helmet by the
                Throne (x 2100 y 540), and again Durlag will appear.  This
                time, however, he explodes into three seperate Greater
                Dopplegangers, and this battle is quite fun.  Ugh.

                Douglas D. sent me this:

                  "A little note on dealing with the throne-room dopplegangers
                  in Durlag's Tower that has worked for me.  My main character
                  had the boots of speed at this point in the game (or use a
                  haste spell from one of the scrolls in the SE room).  I had
                  him (a paladin) run up and grab the helm and race back to the
                  entrance, keeping the rest of the party in the entrance room
                  to that level.  Everytime I ran back with the helm, the door
                  to the throne room would close after Durlag gives his crazy
                  speech.  After that, the dopplegangers would cast their
                  cloudkill/stinking cloud spells and soften themselves up.

                  "After the spells disapated, I attacked the appropriate dummy
                  in the NW room, opened the door back up, and took out the
                  dopplegangers without too much trouble."

                Go into the North West passage (you can go into the South East
                one as well, but I like the NW one).  Be very careful of traps
                as there are about 8 or so in here.  There is also a potion on
                the ground, don't drink it.  Once you go into the next room,
                you will have to start fighting various members of Durlag's
                family which are really Greater doppelgangers in disguise,
                Islanne, Kiel, Fuernabol, and Durlag.  They aren't as tough as
                you might think.

                In this room get the Teleportation Rune from a pot (x 865
                y 700) once you have it, weird runes will appear on the ground.
                Click on them to teleport to the other side of the room.

                Go into the next room (x 392 y 1047) and disarm all the traps.
                Every one of the treasures on the walls is trapped with
                lightning and each contains a Potion of Healing.  Go South-East
                through the door and into the little room here.  Search the
                giant Statue (x 725 y 1165) to get the Exit Rune for this level
                then quickly exit this room since the statue will soon after
                start launching a couple of Cloudkill Spells.

                Now go through the passage to the South West, of course you
                have learned to check for traps, as there are fireball traps
                down here as well as some Ghasts.  Go down to the room with the
                Stairs, but DON'T go down these stairs since they are trapped
                and fake (x 1034 y 1868).  If you do click on them, not only
                will you stay on this level but a Stinking Cloud Spell will be
                launched at the middle of the stairs (where your party is) and
                some Skeleton Warriors will appear (pretty tough fight). If you
                want go into the next room and search for treasures, it is
                covered down in Other.  To kill the 4 Dwarven Doom Guards
                there, entangle them all with the spell of the same name
                (although it is almost certain that you'll need more than 2
                Entangle Spells to entangle them all).  After that, start
                launching Fireballs or Magic Missiles at them (preferably with
                a wand) since they can endure a couple of these to kill them.
                Be advised that if you decide to search the chest at the feet
                of the bed, they'll attack you (that is why we kill them before
                doing this since they are guarding it).  You can also explore
                the rest of the level (the other path) if you wish.  There is a
                secret door to the South that opens with the Rune stone
                containing the real stairs that lead out of this level.  Go
                south and down these stairs (x 1044 y 2279).

  Level 4 Underground (AR 0513):  The first thing you'll notice when you open
                the door is that Fireballs are being constantly fired in this
                room.  There are some treasures in this room (Magic Darts,
                Potions, etc...) at (x 3094 y 1243) and (x 3176 y 1135) and
                (x 3227 y 2039) and (x 3272 y 1253).  To get them, you'll have
                to cast Haste or equip one of your characters with Boots of
                Speed (so that he can get away from the constantly shooting
                Fireballs and not get fried).  You'll need multiple passes to
                get all the treasures from all 4 locations.  Once you got what
                you wanted, head into the North-West room.

                In there, a skeleton (x 2365 y 632) will talk to you explaining
                what you'll need to do to be able to get out of this room.
                Basically, you can get your own little Hero Army by touching
                the statues there.  Do so, and you will get 5 Dire Charmed
                "Heroes", although since some of them are monsters, it's not
                very heroic.  You can use them to fight off the Greater Wyverns
                in here (use them as cannon fodder while the real firepower
                comes from all of your characters equipped with ranged weapons.
                And like all Dire Charmed creatures, they will eventually turn
                on you (so once all 3 Greater Wyverns are dead, kill the
                "Heroes".  One of these "Heroes" has a Full Plate. In the
                bottom left of this room is the exit.

                Follow the tunnel but do not enter in any cavern yet.  Instead,
                get to a room with the large masks.  Click on each of them to
                know what is to do.  At this point, you can either go into the
                4 caverns and kill the "Special" Monster or explore the rest of
                the level.  There are 2 rooms to the north. The one to your
                left has various round platforms and skeleton archers. There
                are a lot of them, they aren't worth much xp, and don't have
                any good treasures. Skip. The garden room at the East of the
                map contains Kala's Axe (careful, it's trapped) and also 3
                Ashirukurus (Invisible backstabbing Sirines).  Once you're done
                exploring, head back to the room with the masks.

                There are now Four Tunnels each to the southwest, for
                simplicity let's number them, the bottom-most being 1 the
                topmost being 4.  Enter each tunnel and kill every Special
                Monsters that are inside.  Once you kill the fourth special
                Monster, you'll be automatically teleported out to a giant
                chess board.

                Tunnel 1:  There are 2 or 3 Phoenix Guards in here.  If you've
                           never fought these before, when you kill them, they
                           explode into a Fireball.  Kill them with ranged
                           weapons, or use fire resistance. If you don't have
                           either, make sure they die separately. Make sure
                           that they are actually dead before continuing, as
                           they can return from death.

                Tunnel 2:  In this room you will find an Air Aspect (it looks
                           an awful lot like a Baby Wyvern but much faster) and
                           3 Invisible Stalkers.

                Tunnel 3:  Here you will find a Fission Slime.  You must kill
                           it with Fire.  Any other method, and the Slime will
                           divide and you'll have 2 to kill.

                Tunnel 4:  In this room are 4 winter wolves, and a Polar Bear
                           named Kaldran The Bear (if you want to gather their
                           pelts to sell in Nashkel, don't do this room last,
                           do tunnel 3 last).

                You are now on a giant chess board.  There are some vague rules
                to follow here, but I wouldn't worry too much about them.
                Launch your most powerful magics (such as oh... Fireball) to
                take out the pawns, then lay into the more powerful enemies
                with your fighters and archers.  Be sure to check the treasures
                when you win to get the Two Handed Sword +3 on the King.

                Go through the north east door to get to the fifth level.

  Level 5 Underground (AR 0514):  Walk a little south and east, ignore the
                door to the southwest, and talk to Durlag, but this time he
                doesn't turn into anything and doesn't try to kill you.  He
                instead merely offers some advice.  How nice.

                Continue past him up the passage.  You will notice a secret
                door on the right (x 3293 y 1393), go into it and into a very
                large green area.  There are lots of secret passages here, and
                be quick when walking on the green puddles, as they are acidic
                and hurt you.  There are lots of little treasures along the way
                in the small puddles that are connected to the walls and in the
                packs of mushrooms growing on the floor.  Some decent potions,
                but otherwise not that significant. Make your way west, through
                a secret wall to (x 674 y 3152) and kill Grael there.  Search
                the mushrooms by the wall to get the Compass Rune.

                Now go up to (x 4000 y 2680) and through this secret passage.
                In the chest at (x 4281 y 2200) you will find the Long Sword +1
                Flametongue and a Staff of Striking, two very good weapons.  Go
                around the passage to the North and West to (x 3785 y 1862).
                There are a LOT of gems here.  Click on the throne (x 3805
                y 1851) to be teleported to a strange room with statues.  Talk
                to the North East statue, the answer is the Third option.  You
                can also talk to the other statues in this room if you wish
                (they give you the clues to be able to answer the riddle of the
                North East statue).

                You will be back at the beginning of the level near Durlag's
                Ghost.  Go back up the same passage, but instead of going down
                the secret passage, continue forward.  You will find the Ghost
                of Islanne near (x 3866 y 749), and turn her offer down for now
                (unless you want to leave Durlag's Tower and have to come all
                the way back).  Open the door to the northwest first, kill
                the Helmed Horrors. Search the room for the Bone Warstone.
                Open the door to the South West, and go through it.  You are
                now in a large chamber.  Avoid the Runes on the ground as they
                will shoot spells at you.  Continue down the hall into the
                room with the machine (x 2109 y 749) and use it (it will take
                the Bone Wardstone) to deactivate the traps on the previous
                room.

                Go back to the runed room. Be sure to pick up the treasures
                (see Level 5 Underground Treasures in the Other Section).  When
                you are ready, click on the stretched leather (looks like a
                bed) at (x 2500 y 700).  Talk to the topmost statue, this time
                it is the first answer.  You can also talk to the other statues
                in this room if you wish (again, they give you the clues to be
                able to answer the riddle of the topmost statue).

                Again you are back at the start of the level.  Now go through
                the door which is just to the South West of Durlag's Ghost.  Go
                down the passage to a large room filled with Spiders and
                Ettercaps.  From there go to the statue at (x 1860 y 830), and
                click on it.  He asks you several of these possible questions:

                  Who is Durlag's eldest son?        Kiel
                  Who was Durlag's younger son?      Fuernebol
                  What was Durlag's nickname?        Trollkiller
                  What name was Bolher known?        Thunderaxe
                  Who was the 'mother of the sons'?  Islanne

                You will be teleported to another room with some statues, and
                again you talk to the top one.  Tell him the third answer.  You
                can also talk to the other statues in this room if you wish
                (they give you the clues to be able to answer the riddle of the
                topmost statue).

                And for the last time you are teleported back.  Talk to
                Durlag's Ghost, and tell him that you will fight the Evil.  He
                will then walk up the passageway, follow him.  He opens up the
                South-East passage by Islanne, go through that and open the
                door.  Here you meet up with Clair De'Laine who was with
                Dalton's party, who are all now dead except for her, the
                Demonknight having killed them all.  She will tell you a way to
                beat the Demon easily, having to do with a special mirror, if
                you listen.  There is a treasure chest here (trapped, as usual)
                with a Cloak of the Shield in it.  When you're ready, go down
                the stairs.

  Level 6 Underground (AR 0506):  In the center of the room is the Demonknight.
                Kill him to get 15000 exp, a Large Shield +1, and the
                Soultaker.  Here, you have two options:  killing the
                Demonknight the old fashioned way or attacking the mirror that
                he's standing by.  Attacking the mirror will cause the
                summoning of some creatures that will attack everyone in the
                room (including the Demon Knight).  If the summoned creatures
                kill him (which happens 100% of the time unless you kill them
                first)), you will not get the 15000 exp and you will have to
                then dispose of them (although they are easier to kill
                individually than the Demonknight is for a low level party).
                Don't go too crazy buffing your party before attacking, his
                first tactic is to cast dispel magic on you.

                Once beaten, talk to Dalton (x 1160 y 470) on the east side,
                who will run off.

  The easiest way out is to take Islanne up on her teleportation offer.  Then
  you want to return to Ulgoth's Beard to return the Soultaker to Hurgan and
  talk with Dalton's mother (Therella) to get your reward (see Ulgoth Beard
  Section above).

2c. Ulgoth's Beard Revisited (Or the Soultaker and The Aec'Letec)    [CUBRSA]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Treasures:  War Hammer +1, +4 vs. Giants (Hurgan's Reward)

Plot:
  - When you first re-arrive in Ulgoth's Beard you will be confronted by a Cult
    Leader, who steals your Soultaker.  Plus you will then be attacked by a
    bunch of raving lunatic cultists Archers and Warriors who look
    like Flaming Fist.

  - Go to the Inn and talk to Hurgan about the Soultaker.  He'll inform you
    that the Cult worships a demon, and some other stuff about his granda and
    Durgan.  The gist of it is that you have to find the cultists since the
    Soultaker contains the Demon.

  - Wander up to (x 1275 y 655) and talk to the Cult Guard there.  You cannot
    bribe him so don't bother trying.  Just hack your way through him.  He
    will, of course, summon more guards to help out.  Go inside the Building
    that he was guarding.

  - In here you will find a Cult Wizard, two Cult Assasins, and a Cult Archer.
    They'll talk to you, and I chose to fight the pants off of them.  He also
    tells you that you are too late, and that the Demon will already be free
    by the time you get there.  Go down the stairs (save first!).

      Note:  Aec'Letec attacks almost entirely with magic. Potions of Magic
             Blocking and similar will greatly reduce his abilities to harm
             you.

  - Again a cultist will talk to you telling you that you are too late.  Kill
    the woman magic user first then the cultists (if you kill Aec'Letec while
    any of them are still alive, he will regenerate completely from their form
    which means that you would have to fight him again!).  When he dies you get
    16000 exp.

      Note:  I've heard that Aec'Letec is particularly weak against Cloudkills.

  - Finally go back and talk to Hurgan and ask for your reward to get his War
    Hammer +1, +4 vs. Giants.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Werewolves Island (AR 2000)                                       [3TSWWI]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  To get to the Werewolves' Island you talk to Mendas back in Ulgoth's
       Beard. He sends you to Baldur's Gate's Counting House Inn to retrieve
       the Sea Charts first. See the Ulgoth's Beard section above for more
       details.

Companions:  none

Enemies:  Brown Bears

Plot:
  - Talk to Solianna (x 4440 y 3375) and pump her for information about the
    island.  She'll tell you that they arrived here the same way you did, boat
    crashing, and that there are "beasties" about.  Based on the name of the
    Island, I'm sure you can guess what those might be.  She also mentions that
    they may still have a ship around somewhere.  Which you may want, unless
    you plan on staying here.

  - Wander up into the village.  Don't worry, you can't miss it.  If you try to
    talk to anyone, they'll tell you to talk to Kaishas, the Headwoman.

  - You will find the Headwoman (Kaishas) a little to the north (x 3268
    y 1250) in the first building in the village.  Go inside and talk to her.
    Mention Mendas as hired you, and she'll perk up a bit.  Try to get
    information on the shipwreck.  She says that they are building a new ship,
    but they need you to get rid of the Werewolves so that they can finish the
    ship.  You can't get any money for this, but you can get off the island.

  - When you want to leave the village, go out the hole in the wall at
    (x 2500 y 670), and from there north to the next area.

Subquests:
  - Maralee's Son
    Maralee's Son was kidnapped by the Werewolves.  Agree to find him and bring
    him back if he is alive.  His name is Peladan.  You'll find Peladan on the
    Fourth Level of the Shipwreck.  Return him to Maralee to get your reward:
    4000 xp.
    Maralee:  Werewolves' Island Village (x 3623 y 1471)
    Peladan:  Shipwreck, Level Four (on Karoug)

  - Durlyle's (or Delainy's) Cloak
    Just west of Kaishas's hut you'll find Durlyle (or Delainy). Talk to
    Durlyle and he'll tell you that during a storm, an important symbol of the
    people's past was taken from them, a cloak.  He asks you to retrieve it.
    You will find the Holy Cloak in Dradeel's hut (which is covered in the
    next section), but you can't really take it until you return Dradeel's
    spell book to him.  You don't get anything when you return it to Durlyle,
    except some stories.  (On a side note "Durlyle's" identity depends on your
    main character's sex, if you are female then Durlyle is a male, if you are
    a male then Durlyle becomes Delainy, a female)
    Durlyle:  Werewolves' Island Village (x 2525 y 1234)
    Cloak:  Werewolve's North (x 4200 y 1600)

Other:
  - Minor Treasures

    which he means for you to kill every Werewolf that you can.
    Lahl:  Werewolves' Island Village (x 2638 y 1016)

  - Farthing's Dolly
    You'll meet a little girl who had her little dolly stolen by a werewolf.
    Being a protector of the innocents and hero, you agree to bring her back
    her dolly.  You'll find her dolly on Palin (a Werewolf in disguise who'll
    lead you into a trap) on the next map. Return her dolly for 1400 xp.
    Farthing:  Werewolves' Island Village (x 2127 y 2244)
    Palin:  Werewolves' Island North (AR 1500, x 1635 y 3240)

  - Evalt, the Witch and Evan
    Here you'll meet Evalt who'll explain to you that is brother, Evan, was
    captured by a Witch and asks you to bring him back to the village.  In
    fact, the Witch is a Sirine Queen who wanted to mate with him but
    discovered that he was not a man (you'll read why below) and killed him.
    Now, we can't accept that can we?  Find her, kill her then bring the body
    of Evan back to Evalt for 900 xp.
    Evalt:  Werewolves' Island Village (x 2230 y 2683)
    Sirine Queen:  Werewolves' Island North (AR 1500, x 200 y 1216)

  - Jorin
    If you talk to the soldier just outside the gate, you can ask him for
    tips on fighting the wolves.
    Jorin:  Werewolves' Island Village (x 2447 y 1941)

  - Belladonna Flowers
    You can pick yourself some of the Belladonna flowers at (x 1694 y 200) or
    (x 963 y 213).  Durlyle (or Delainy) will ask for them later (once you
    bring back the cloak).

          Bears, Dire Wolves, Black Bears, Brown Bears, Wolves

Plot:
  - Go north and up to a building at (x 4185 y 1607), go inside and talk to the
    Mage Dradeel inside.  He was part of the original party with Balduran, and
    witnessed the birth of the monsters.  He has a lot to say.  Agree to help
    him.  For your help, he will give you the Wolfsbane Amulet, and tell you to
    fetch his Spellbook from the shipwreck.

  - The entrance to the Shipwreck is at (x 3652 y 1057)

Treasures:  Wolfsbane Amulet (Dradeel)
            Staff Mace (Dradeel's Treasures)

    Palin is one of them.  He is also carrying Farthing's dolly (see Other
    Section in Werewolves Island above).
    Palin:  Werewolves' Island North (x 1635 y 3240)

  - Kryla and Jondal
    A woman named Kryla will approach you near the center of the area, and ask
    for your help in getting vengeance for the death of her son Jondal.  And,
    you guessed it, she's a wolfwere too.
    Kryla:  Werewolves' Island North (x 3630 y 2050)

Other:
  - Meym
    Another Wolfwere (in human disguise) can be found here.
    Meym:  Werewolves' Island North (x 767 y 2361).

  - Dradeel's Treasures
    Once Dradeel has his spellbook and has teleported away, you can loot his
    little room.  You can get:  Holy Cloak, Staff Mace, 210gp, Plant, and
    Dradeel's Cook Book.

  - Sirine Queen and 4 Sirines
    The Sirine Queen can be found here (see Other Section in Werewolves Island
    above).  She'll also summon 4 Sirines near the water to help her out (if
    you decide to fight her).  I suggest you lure her inland so you can fight
    her alone, then go pick her summoned friends afterward (near the water).
    Sirine Queen:  Werewolves' Island North (x 200 y 1216).

3b. Shipwreck (AR 1501, 1502, 1503, 1504)                            [BSHPWR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  Here, it's safe to assume that every chest, barrels and other
       searchables are trapped (also some floor traps) so use your Thief
       wisely.  Also, I suggest that you clean out the first level of the ship
       on enemies, search it, cast any appropriate magic to help your party in
       a dangerous battle then head directly to the fourth level.  You can
       easily get there without sustaining any damage since all the stairs are
       close together.  Once the Fourth level has been sanitized, go down and
       do the same for each level. (if you're playing in Tutu or BGT, don't do
       this, the enemies will all follow you up)

Companions:  none

Enemies:  Dire Wolves, Dread Wolves, Wargs, Vampiric Wolves, Wolfweres,

Treasures:  Werebane, Silver Dagger +1 (Level 2 Treasures)
            Cloak of Protection +1 (Head Wolfwere)
            Shield Amulet (Head Wolfwere)
            Sword of Balduran (Balduran's Office)

Plot:
  - You will be in the bottom of the ship.  There will be a lot of monsters
    down here.  Go up the ladder.

  - More monsters here, as well as some treasures (see Level 2 Treasures
    below).  Go up the next ladder.

  - There's one trapped box here with some minor treasures in it.  Go up the
    ladder.

  - On this level is the Head Wolfwere.  Talk to him and then later kill him.
    You also have to fight off a lot of monsters here.  Greater Wolfweres
    require a +3 weapon or better to hit. You can pick up Dradeel's Spellbook
    at (x 450 y 270), but be careful of traps.  Check the body of the Head
    Wolfwere for a Cloak of Protection +1, a Shield Amulet and also search the
    body of Karoug to find Peladan (see Other Section in Werewolves Island
    above).

  - Go into Balduran's Office, be careful of the traps, and take the three
    things in his desk:  Sword of Balduran, Log Book of Balduran, and the
    Butterknife of Balduran (AR 1504, x 581 y 201).  You can find Dradeel's
    Spellbook at (AR 1504, x 436 y 266).

  - Return to Dradeel and give him the spell book and he teleports away.  You
    get 5000 exp.

Subquests:
  - Maralee's Son
    You will find Peladan on the body of Karoug (see Other Section in
    Werewolves Island above).

Other:
  - Level 1 Treasures
    Wand of Magic Missiles, 320gp, 10 Magic Darts +1

    wounding, 5 Potions of Healing, Potion of Master Thievery at (x 210 y 506)

    Cursed Bracers of Binding at (AR 1502, x 271 y 521)

  - Level 3 Treasures
    2 Antidotes, 1 Potion of Absorption, 1 Medium Shield (TRAPPED) at
    (AR 1503, x 657 y 165) and 5 Acid Arrows, 1 Potion of Cloud Giant Strength,
    3 Healing Potions (TRAPPED) at (AR 1503, x 233 y 467) and 10 Arrows +2,

3c. Return to the Village                                            [CTSRTT]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  Be advise that once everyone in the town have transformed back to
       werewolves, they will respawn quite quickly so finish your exploration
       of the village and subquests before speaking to Kaishas Gan (unless you
       like to kill monsters that can only be damaged by magic weapons).

Enemies:  Werewolves

Plot:
  - Be sure to talk with Durlyle, and Maralee and all others to resolve the
    appropriate subquests (do not talk to Kaishas Gan until all the wanted
    subquests are concluded).  Once you give the Cloak to Durlyle, speak to him
    again and he will ask you to fetch him some Flowers (see the Other in
    section 3 above on where to find some), and then he likes you.

  - Go talk to Kaishas again, and she'll tell you all about the village and its
    people, the truth this time.  Turns out that they are Lycanthropes as well,
    but the reverse of the Wolfweres, they are Werewolves (the difference is
    that Wolfweres start out as wolves and turn human, while Werewolves start
    as human and turn into wolves).  I suggest you don't take her up on her
    offer to "belong", she will then steal your Sea Charts, and her companion
    will turn into a Werewolf and attack you as she sneaks out.

  - Go back outside and EVERYONE in the town is now a Werewolf!

  - Go to (x 2700 y 1350) to find Durlyle who offers to get you out of the
    village through some secret underground passages.  Follow him to the hut at
    (x 1650 y 1520) where Dradeel will give you more information.  Turns out
    that these people are the ones that killed the crew in the first place.  He
    also mentions that there are "Dark Ones" on the ship that you must find.
    Talk to Durlyle again.

  - Now go into the Hut, and down into the secret passage.

3d. Underground Passage (AR 2012)                                    [DTSNDR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enemies: Werewolves, Loup Garou (these can only be hit by VERY magical weapons,
         such as the Long Sword +1: Flametongue, and Balduran's Sword)

Plot:
  - The only thing to do here is to head East to the exit (x 3025 y 360).  And
    you can pick up some potions if you want.  And fight Werewolves.

  - You exit onto a hidden beach on the North End of the Island, walk over to
    the ship and talk to Kaishas.  In any event she'll turn into a Loup Garou,
    a slightly tougher Werewolf.  Kill her and take your charts back.  Click on
    the sail to return to the Mainland.

Other:
  - Potions
    Potion of Storm Giant Strength, 2 Healing Potions -- (x 1336 y 808)
    Potion of Cold Resistance -- (x 1817 y 594)
    Potion of Defense -- (x 2555 y 555)
    Oil of Speed -- (x 2362 y 243)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Treasures:  Chainmail +3 (Baresh)

Plot:
  - Well we made it back in one piece.  You will be met on the docks by Baresh,
    who demands to know what has happened.  Tell him what you will.  Go to
    Mendas (who we now know is Chief Selaad Gan).  He demands answers, you may
    as well tell him the truth, and be prepared for a fight.  Baresh and him
    both become Loup Garou and attack you.  Search Baresh's old body for a
    Chainmail +3.  Also search his house to find 980gp.



Note: Once all the Tales of the Sword Coast quests are done, you get a little
      message (similar to the End of Chapter messages) telling you that you are
      done with it.

Monster Fighting Strategies:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  "Dryad" Fighting:
    A dryad (or any other female monster type, such as the Siren) has some
    nasty magical attacks, namely Charm Person, which if used on the right
    person in your party, screws you over.  Nothing worse than having to fight
    your own best fighter.  So if you lose too many people to her, then go back
    to your last save, then send only your best fighter to where the dryad is.
    If your fighter is charmed, no big deal (enemies won't attack charmed party
    members, so you won't get killed).  Once she is out of the worst magical
    attacks, send in the cavalry.  If one of your people is Dire Charmed
    anyway, cast a quick Hold Person on them to keep them from fighting you.

    One other thing to try is to send a good archer (Bracers of Archery always
    help) to kill her quickly.

    Minsc's "Berserk" attack makes him fairly immune to Dire Charm. (He still
    gets charmed, but will attack the Sirine/Dryad anyway)

    Or if your people do get charmed, you can just cast Dire Charm on them
    again to reverse it. (thanks to D Sanders for that)

  "Basilisk" Fighting:
    Basilisks are nasty creatures, they turn you to stone.  If they turn your
    main character to stone, that is considered Death, and therefore the end of
    your game.  So if you have a Protection from Petrification spell/scroll you
    may want to use that. The spell is a first level mage spell, and you can
    buy it at High Hedge. Also if you get Korax (Area E of Temple) to join you
    (temporarily), he is immune to Petrification. (although the Basilisks could
    still kill him, and he will turn against you eventually!)

  Doomsayer Fighting
    So there's only one Doomsayer (Area S of Lighthouse), but he's a tough one.
    Cast lots of magic missiles at him since they always hit and do a bit of
    damage.  Keep your best fighters between him and your party, and try
    hitting him with magic arrows as well.  If one of your people gets injured
    by about 3/4 of their total HP, pull them back.  Don't try to tackle him
    before level 6 or so.

B. Miscellaneous Information                                         [ABMSCI]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Baldur's Gate follows most every AD&D rule in the Player's Handbook.  That
doesn't mean that they are all documented in the manual, however.  And this
section is a good a place as any to stick all the missing information from the
Rules. (all information here is taken directly from the AD&D Player's Handbook,
which may not entirely reflect how the rules work in Baldur's Gate!)

Mega Constitution and Regeneration:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  If your Constitution gets above 19 you get an automatic regeneration.  Here's
  a little table on it:

                     Constitution:        Regeneration Rate:
                     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                          20                 1 per 6 rounds
                          21                 1 / 5
                          22                 1 / 4
                          23                 1 / 3
                          24                 1 / 2
                          25                 1 / 1

  A round is about 6 seconds.

C. The Gods of the Realm                                             [ACTGOR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've tried to compile a list of every god mentioned in the game.  Naturally, I
probably missed one or two, so if I did, please email me about it.  There is
some neat information on the gods and their troubles on page 67 of the Baldur's
Gate Manual.  And lots of information comes from Orlandu.  Others come from
edwardalacey.

Auril    -- mentioned by Branwen, Goddess of Winter, mentioned by Branwen and
            the boots of cold are hers as well.  Auril believes that everything
            should be turned to ice.
Bane, Bhall, and Myrkul -- the "dead three" gods, but are currently not in
            "power" (it's a long story)
Baravar  -- worshipped by Quayle
Clangeddin -- a god mentioned by Yeslick.
Cyric    -- evil god worshipped by Bassilus to raise the dead, also Mulahey has
            a Cyric Holy Symbol on him.  Makes Cyric seem a little suspicious,
            doesn't it?  Cyric took the power from the "dead three" and now
            does everything they did, thus making him the new god of murder.
Deneir -- one of gods who protects Tethtoril (see his decription in the manual)
Garl Glittergold -- worshipped in the Temple of Wisdom at the Friendly Arm Inn
Gond     -- god of artifice and invention.  The Hall of Wonders in Baldur's
            Gate is run by Gondish priests.
Helm     -- a good god, worshipped by Ajantis.  There's a Helm temple in
            Nashkel. He is the God of Guardians, and he guards the Outer
            Realms.
Ilmater  -- God of Suffering who enchanted the Large Shield +4 vs. Missiles.  I
            may not have spelt his name correctly.
Jergal   -- former god of the dead, gave his power to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul
            (History of the Dead Three), and now is the Scribe of the Dead
Kozah    -- ancient god of various chaotic happenings (like earthquakes), there
            is an ancient temple being unearthed of his far to the SW of
            Beregost, but beware the curse!
Lord Ao  -- the Overpower.  Not a god as per se, since he is infinitely more
            powerful than they are (he can destroy them at will)
Lathander -- Worshipped in the Song of the Morning temple
Lloth    -- Spider Goddess of the Drow, dislikes Drizzt and Viconia.  There is
            another Drow god mentioned in one of the "History of the Drow"
            books, Ghaunadaur.
Malar    -- Mentioned by Osmadi, also known as the Beastlord.  He is an evil
            god that doesn't much like the Druid faiths.
Mystra   -- goddess of magic
Oak Father -- I think this is a God of Nature, worshipped by Faldorn.
Oghma    -- there is a temple to Oghma is Candlekeep as he is the God of
            Knowledge
Selune   -- a Goddess mentioned by Dradeel
Shar     -- Goddess of the Night, worshipped by the renegade drow Viconia
Sune     -- good god, the Holy Ring is a Sune artifact, she is the Goddess of
            Love and Beauty.
Talos    -- made the Boots of Grounding, and is possibly a God of Storms
Tempus   -- Branwen is a cleric of this Neutral God, the God of Battles
Tymora   -- She's the Goddess of Luck (good luck that is, Besheba is the
            Goddess of Bad Luck)
Umberlee -- goddess of the Sea, aka the "Bitch Queen", you run into her
            priestess at the Baldur's Gate Bridge. (btw, Umberlee is of an Evil
            alignment)
Valkur   -- another god mentioned by Branwen, he is the god of sailors

D. Guide to Naming Characters                                        [DGDTNC]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have heard that some people have trouble coming up with creative names for
their characters.  So here is a little guide to coming up with interesting
names that seem to fit into the game (i.e. names that aren't "brad" or "mike"
or something).

Method 1:
  Take an exisiting last name, and make it a first name.
  Ex: Corbin, Martens, Miller.
  Obviously this doesn't work with all last names, and it also tends to skew
  mostly male.

Method 2:
  You can also make interesting names by taking an existing name, such as Kate,
  and flipping some letters around to make a new name, Kaet.

Method 3:
  Somewhat similar to method 2, this one merely involves adding useless vowels.
  Try adding an 'a' before an 'e' or an 'i' after an 'e'.  Take the name
  Patrick for example.  It will become Paetrick.

Method 4:
  Another fun thing to try is to simply add a new "flourish" to an existing
  name.  For example we start with "Nate" and add the "flourish" "ylia" to make
  the new name "Natylia".

Method 5:
  Start with another word, say the number "Seven".  Replace the vowels with new
  vowels to make "Sivan".  Now if you want to make it feminine add an "y" (or
  something similar) to the end to make "Sivany".  Or try this, start with the
  word "talent".  Replace the first 't' with a "th" and then replace the 'e'
  with an 'a'.  You now have "Thalant", which is a good name, but needs a
  little flourish of "yr" to finish it "Thalantyr".

Method 6: (from MartectX)
  I found another strategy of making names "fitting the game": Just take an
  existing name backwards! Some examples: Martin - Nitram, Florian - Nairolf,
  Monika - Akinom, Andrea - Aerdna.

Here's a list of names that I have used in various RPG games.  This list will
be a little small for now, but as I get more of them, I'll add them.  If you
have any name that you want to send in, please feel free!

  Karyana                            Khaar the Bloody
  Ceqeen'ah

The following names are from Bane:

  Lyria                              Taaryn (Taryn)
  Kestyn                             Yulosa
  Maya                               Astyk
  Galian                             Bane

The following names, and strategy, were sent to me by Preston Lloid:

  Female:                            Male:
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                            ¯¯¯¯¯
  Jephinia Justice                   Edcam Sielfir
  Misha Kintyre                      Purl Sielfir
  Latista Dymnir                     Paxus Silatis
  Kyndria Valmund                    Bastius Mnotarior
  Shaloa Fighro                      Rhymnir Kaleef
  Syff Kintous                       Kelt Incurrigate
  Geila Mist                         Solas Imnikurr
                                     Tarrento Gymnica

  I also found that nearly all the months make fine female first names (e.g.
  October, November etc.).  Furthermore I personally think that there's nothing
  wrong with giving your character a first name and some kind of call name
  instead of an actual surname (or family name).  For instance, if you've made
  a female priest with the allignment "lawful good" you might call her "Misha
  the Divine", instead of Misha Kintyre.  Or if you create an evil male mage,
  you could call him "Tarrento the Dreadful".

E. Character Sounds                                                  [ECHRCT]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you will find a typed out version of a great many sounds in the game.
Check out the sndlist.txt file in the Sounds directory if you want to change
one of the PC Sounds.  Any of the NPC sounds that has a ????????? in it means
that I listened to the sounds by using the biffstripper utility, but I'm not
quite sure where they fit into the context of the game.

The "Repeated Selected" sounds are accessed when you click on a character about
9 times in a row.

This comes from Patrick:

  I thought I'd help fill in some of the blanks regarding NPC quotes, and
  how they relate to one another, which you might want to include in any
  possible updates of your astounding FAQ.

  First off, there are NPCs who will try to kill each other eventually, as I
  found out when I first played and took Xzar/Montaron and Khalid/Jaheira into
  the Nashkel mines, and some of their quotes are reserved for such an
  occasion.  At a seemingly random point, the text window popped up and the
  dialogue followed:

    Jaheira:  "Do you claim to fight evil... (etc.)"
    Xzar:  "Why must you goad us..."
    Jaheira:  "I know nothing of gold..."
    Xzar:  "I begin to see your true nature..."

  Likewise, Khalid and Montaron have some lines which suggest a similar
  exchange (sound files 30 and 31 for each).  At this point, Montaron and Xzar
  (the Zhentarim) and Khalid and Jaheira (the Harpers), squared off and began
  fighting, ignoring my commands and leaving my character with nothing to do
  but pick a side and join in.  (This is indeed at least partly random... not
  caring for the deaths of two NPCs, I loaded a previous savegame, finished the
  mines, then disbanded the Zhentish pair without incident.)

  Odds are that when a character makes a direct statement to another, there is
  a reply (Some of Montaron's jibes are in response to Xzar's babblings, and
  Khalid and Jaheira share some tender moments).  I haven't gotten far in the
  game yet, but here are some possible relationships which suggest themselves:

    Eldoth and Alora:  Alora always tries to cheer up Eldoth, and he in turn
                       actually finds himself softening up when she's around.
    Xan and Ajantis:  As you've noticed, Xan rejects Ajantis' strict views,
                      and Ajantis does not respond kindly to his paradigms
                      being challenged.
    Eldoth just seems to piss off everybody...

    Also, if it helps straighten things out, I noticed (using the playsound
    ingame cheat) that the number of the file for each character is connected
    with its function in the game, as follows:

      1 - Introduction
    In battle:
      2 - Battlecry
      3 - Morale Break
    Comments on party's reputation and actions:
      4 - Happy
      5 - Unhappy
      6 - Angry
      7 - Breaking Point
    Comments on personal status:
      8 - Made Leader
      9 - Tired
     10 - Bored
     11 - Wounded
    Comments on environment:
     12 - Forest
     13 - City
     14 - Dungeon
     15 - Daytime
     16 - Nighttime
    Comments toward player:
     17-19 - Selected
     20-22 - Commanded
     23-26 - Annoyed
    Comments toward NPCs:
     27-37 - Various Banterings
    Comments on death:
     38 - Generic Death
     39 - Specific Death

    Of course, Imoen throws this whole scheme off track, but it seems like
    everybody else sticks by it.    (again, this was from Patrick)

    On Eldoth's Death:         "I would grieve for Eldoth, if it were not for

  Exp Cap Removers:
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Godlike (144kb download, version 1.1)
      This really cool utility removes the experience cap from any version of
      Baldur's Gate, including the Tales of the Sword Coast.  If you don't
      know, there is a limit to how much experience you can get in the regular
      game, and this removes that limit.  Really cool.

      Note: If you install an Official Patch after using Godlike, the cap will
            be back in place, and may muck up the game, so you will need to
            check for a new version of Godlike, and run it again.

Item Copying:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  You don't actually have to be playing multiplayer for this to work, it just
  really helps.  You also don't have to be actually playing with anyone else to
  be playing as multiplayer.  One thing to do when you find any item of value
  would be to:

    1. Save the game.
    2. Export the Character with the item(s) that you wish to copy. (only works
       with characters that you have created yourself, such as the main
       character)
    3. Give all of that character's items away, and then click the bottom
       button (Multiplayer Options), then click the Modify Characters button
       (only works if there are no enemies around, and you aren't in the middle
       of casting a spell), and then click on the Character Name to delete the
       character.
    4. Now immediately Import the character back, and you now have 2 of
       everything that person had.

  Similarly if you are doing this in a single player, you:

    1. Export the Character.
    2. Start a new game.
    3. At the Character Creation Screen press "Import" and the select your
       character.

  It is really helpful that when you Export your Character to name him/her
  something specific, not just "Character1" or something.

  This is really useful for the ultra-rare items like the Full Plate +1.  This
  also works well if you want to start over, simply export your character,
  start a new game, and import them there!

      MISC:                                      All of these rings function as
                                            ___  if the spell had been cast
      MAGE01 - Ring of Invisibility            | which means magic resistance
      MAGE02 - Ring of Barkskin                | can stop the effects.  Ignore
      MAGE03 - Ring of Mirror Image            |_the fact that the titles of
      MAGE04 - Pseudo Ring of Blur             | these items may be missing
      MAGE05 - Pseudo Ring of Free Action      | from the descriptions and none
      MAGE06 - Ring of Haste                ___| of them have names as such -
                                                 they just look like scrolls.
               THEY DO WORK!  You need to be careful though as the effects do
               not carry over from saved games like the proper rings do.  This
               means when you load a game you need to take the ring off and put
               it back on again for the effect to work. But some of them are
               worth it.

               Exceptions:  The Pseudo rings do not function i.e. no bonuses at
               all that I can detect.  But the ring of blur does change the
               sprite of your character like the spell does (which I like).
               The other rings work fine.    (from Kelvin Groves)

    2c.  Corrections to the Manual and Quick Reference Card

         Manual Corrections

         p.26  Dual Classing
         The only classes than cannot dual class are the Paladin, Ranger, and
         Bard, though others may have restrictions on which classes they can
         switch to.  The character must also have 15 in all the prime
         requisites of his first class, and 17 in those of the second class.

         The Ranger CAN dual class to a Cleric/Ranger.

    TABLES

      Table 7: Ranged Weapons

      Weapon         |1/2|ROF|Spd|Hit|Dam| Useable By
      ---------------|---|---|---|---|---|------------
      Light Crossbow | 2 | 1 | 7 | - | - | F,R,P,B,T

      Thieves CAN use Light Crossbows, but in the manual and in the game it
      incorrectly states that they cannot.  This makes the "Light Crossbow of
      Speed" a good choice for your thief.

    If you answer as follows when talking to Tremain Belde'ar the game crashes
    (House in BG West AR0617) (from Duncan Clay)

      (2) I Would know what payment I can expect.  I'll not take this task
      with out knowing what it is worth.

      (1) Magic or no.  I should require more than a meager amount of gold.
      Certainly if many adventurers give so much, there be ample coin in
      church holdings?  Make that mine and we have a deal.

  ________________________________
  Inconsistencies and/or Mistakes:
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    After clearing the Cloakwood Mines, talk to Officer Vai and she will say:
    "You efforts have not..."  A clear grammatical mistake.

    When asking Eldoth to rejoin the party he replies with "I though as
    much..." when he meant to say "I thought as much".

    Try this one on for size:  After I had Viconia get kissed by Shoal the
    Nereid, she gets killed, but then later revived.  Now, Viconia didn't
    really have a chance to kill anything after this, and when I checked her
    information it said that her most powerful vanquished foe was "Viconia".

    I had the Subtitles turned on, and when Kivan made his little Tired sound
    ("It is time for us to rest") the text read "I will lead for as long as I
    am needed."

    While in Durlag's Tower while doing the Nymph subquest, every time I went
    up to the Fourth Level, it had reset.  In other words, each time it was
    like I had never been there!  And after freeing Kirinhale, she was still
    there asking for a release!  And here's the best part, if I talked to her
    twice, she gets freed again, and I get the 4000 experience AGAIN!  Not only
    that, but Riggilo is brought back to life as well.  This is very very
    strange!  I am not sure why this happened, or if it will happen on anyone
    else's computer.

  _________
  Oddities:
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    You can kill cows and other animals, and not only will it not affect your
    reputation, but the local townspeople don't even seem to care that you are
    slaughtering their animals!

    You can even kill your own party members, without anyone caring.  Once I
    had Minsc kill Dynaheir, and he still mourned her death later!

    After Melicamp is restored from being a chicken, he will still make Chicken
    noises randomly!

    Is it just me, or do Xvarts look like larger versions of Smurfs?

    Here's a fun one.  While in the Helm and Cloak Inn, I got caught stealing,
    and the guard appeared.  I ignored them so I wouldn't lose anymore than 1
    reputation.  Well there is also a band of adventurers there called the
    Gorpel Hind.  The Gorpel Hind people started killing the Flaming Fist for
    me at no loss to my own reputation!  Sweet!

    I had Coran in my party, and since he is a Fighter/Thief I kept two sets of
    armor for him, one for AC and the other for Thieving (a Plate Mail +1 and
    Shadow Armor respectively) and whenever I would switch from the plate to
    the shadow, he would no longer walk, he would "float" (it looked like he
    was standing still, and just flying).  Odd.  This may also have been
    because he was wearing the Girdle of Femininity at the time.

    I was wandering around with an Evil party, and the reputation wasn't very
    good (it was 4).  Well I went into Nashkel, and naturally, the Amnish
    soldiers there attacked me.  This irritated me, so I went into the temple,
    and bought myself a better reputation (18).  But now, everytime I go
    through Nashkel, I get attacked by these same soldiers, and if I attack
    them, I lose reputation.  Haven't they heard that I'm good now?

    I've gotten an extra party member not mentioned in FAQ (i think he's
    not) twice. When you take a pair of people (like Xzar and Montaron) kill
    the other one away. Leave the other one off normally. I don't know if it
    can be done instantly or only later, but when you take the character
    back to your party, he/she will have a new partner with him/her to
    replace the dead one! I cant remember the name, but he was a human
    warrior with all blue clothes, STR 9 and other stats 6, and no face at
    all, only a ? on the place of the picture. I've done it with
    Khalid/Jaheira and Xzar/Montaron, if I remember correctly, but I did it
    at least once, im sure of that. It's pretty useless but at least its
    fun, I'd say. I tried that today, but I couldn't make it work right now.
    But believe me, I have done it.   (from Juha Alm)

    Got a piece of Baldurs Gate info that you may find interesting.  It is in
    regard to the Character Bub Snikt.  If you don't know this allready I
    believe this character is a link to Marvel Comic's X-Men.  Wolverine (i'm
    sure you know of him)has a couple of 'trademarks'.  One is calling people
    'Bub' and the other is the sound his claws make when he pops them out,
    which is 'SNIKT'.  Well if you didn't know this you do now. :o)
       (from LoGaN©)

  Comedy:
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    In the Red Sheaf Inn in Beregost you can talk to Lachluger, who quotes a
    Monty Python sketch, "Oh I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok, I sleep all night and
    I work all day".

    Speaking of Monty Python, if Garrick gets hurt enough and has to run away
    he will sing "Brave Brave Sir Garrick, Sir Garrick ran away!" straight from
    Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

    After having killed Marl, if you click on his friend Dunkin he will say
    "Hey don't click me!  I don't want any trouble!"

    When Thalantyr is restoring Melicamp from being a chicken he casts the
    dread spell "Antichickenator".

    Some of the graves in the Nashkel cemetery are quite amusing to read.
    Beware, don't read a certain grave too many times or its occupant may kill
    you!  (see the Nashkel section for more information)  Kinda reminds me of
    the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland.

    In the Nashkel Carnival, in one of the tents, you can find a fat commoner
    who claims that he is "Big Boned".  Taken straight from South Park.

    Just South of Nashkel you will find a Kobold named Larry, and his two
    brothers a Tasloi named Darryl, and an Xvart named Darryl.  This was a joke
    from the Bob Newhart Show.

    Two of Yeslick's more uncommon speeches are fairly amusing.  In one he
    says:  "You owe 16 tons, what do you get?" and in another he whistles the
    same theme that the Dwarves do in Snow White and the 7 Dwarves.

      Mer. Pike sent me this:

        I'd like to pass along a useless bit of information that you may or may
        not know about one of Yeslick's lines you mentioned, "You owe 16 tons,
        what do you get?" This line is part of a song by Tennessee Ernie Ford
        which is called, shockingly enough, Sixteen Tons.  It goes something
        like this:

          I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
          I picked up me shovel and walked to the mine
          I loaded sixteen tons of #9 coal
          The straw-boss said, "Well, bless my soul"

          You load sixteen tons and what do you get?
          You get one day older and deeper in debt
          Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
          I owe my soul to the company store

          Well, some people say a man is made out of mud
          I say a poor man's made out of muscle and blood
          Muscle and blood, and skin and bone
          A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

          You load sixteen tons and what do you get?
          You get one day older and deeper in debt
          Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
          I owe my soul to the company store

    Minsc says a lot of funny things, but one of them is from MST3K:
    "I'm Huge!" (from Cave Dwellers, MST3K)

    One of Quayle's lines is: "I am so Smart! S-M-R-T, I mean S-M-A-R-T" which
    is taken directly from the Simpsons, where Homer goes back to college.

    One of Xzar's lines is: "I ate his liver with a nice Chianti and some fava
    beans."  Which is a line from Silence of the Lambs, said by Hannibal
    Lechter.

    A Shar-Teel line goes like this "I don't have time to bleed."  Which is
    quoted from the Predator as said by Jesse Ventura (yes THAT Jesse
    Ventura!).

    Here's a couple lines from Tiax which struck me as funny:  "The day comes
    when TIAX will point and click!" and "Tiax is as Tiax does." a parody on
    Forrest Gump's "Stupid is as Stupid does."  Does that make Tiax stupid?
    Among other things...

    If you click on Khalid a few times he'll stutter out "Th-th-that's all
    folks", the classic Porky Pig line from Looney Tunes.

    Some of Garrick's lines are amusing.  Here's Garricks take on Mr. Rogers:
    "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood." (sung)  And he also does a mean
    Monty Python routine: "Brave brave Sir Garrick, Sir Garrick led the way.
    Brave brave Sir Garrick, Sir Garrick ran away."

    And how about Alora's Ren and Stimpy impersonation: "Happy Happy! Joy Joy!"

    Dennis Matheson has some more:

      Alora - Repeated Selected 2: "C'mon people now, smile
      on your brother. Everybody get together, try to love
      one another right now." - This is the chorus for the
      song "Get Together" by the Youngbloods; a '60s rock
      group.

      Also, it appears that Alora's line "I've heard if you
      go too long without smiling, your face will crack!" is
      directed at Dynaheir.  At least, Dynaheir responds to
      it with her line "I pray thee did not kiss thy mother
      with that mouth."

      Coran - Action Acknowledgement 1:  "Luck be a Lady." -
      Title of a song by Frank Sinatra.

      Dynaheir - Repeated Selected 2: "These boots were made
      for walking, and that's just what they'll do." - From
      the song "These Boots are Made for Walking" by Nancy
      Sinatra.

      (Hmmm... Is there a Sinatra fan at Black Isle?)

      Khalid - Repeated Selected 3: "Ch-ch-ch *hehe*
      ch-ch-chia!" - From the Chia Pet commercials.  (Why?)

      Montaron - Repeated Selected 1: "I warrant your
      attention?  Oh frabgerous day,kaloo kaley!" - From the
      poem Jabberwocky (the "Oh frabgerous day..." part)

      Xzar - Battle Cry: "I have become death!  Destroyer of
      Worlds!" - Robert Oppenheimer allegedly said this
      after the explosion of the first atomic bomb at
      Trinity.  Originally from the Hindu text "Bhagavad
      Gita".

J.  The Dark Side of the Sword Coast                                 [JMMDSS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  So, think that you've done everything that you can possibly do in Baldur's
  Gate and its Expansion, Tales of the Sword Coast?  Well how about adding a
  few new challenges via TeamBG's wonderful little mod pack, called the
  "Dark Side of the Sword Coast"!

  You can find the DSotSC here:

    http://darksideoftheswordcoast.net/

    Note:  The Dark Side of the Sword Coast is NOT in any way shape or form
           supported by BioWare, Black Isle, or Interplay, and as such, if you
           encounter problems with the DSotSC, you should NOT email them!  For
           all support of DSotSC, check out the link above.

  Here is a list of changes/additions that come with the DSotSC mod: (this list
  is taken directly from the DSotSC website)

    * This is an expansion aimed at a 9-12th level party.  So I advise that you
      take the party thru all of TotSC First!  But you have to do that after
      you have installed this expansion.  Otherwise the new areas will not be
      available.  Of course you can always import your party in.
    * 4 major quests well at the level of Durlag's Tower or Werewolf Island.
    * More powerful monsters than anything yet experienced.
    * Over 30 new areas.
    * 100 new spells.
    * Over 70 new critters.
    * 80 new weapons, armor and other items.
    * 8 New NPCs to join your group and some surprises!
    * Experience cap raised to 20 million.
    * Level 40 rules pack is included (instead of the level 20 rules that come
      with BG/TotSC).
    * Included is the program "BG/TotSC Backup Tool" to allow the backup and
      restoring of your original BG/TotSC files (like "dialog.tlk", "Override"
      folder and "Characters" folder).  You MUST use this tool prior to
      installing DSotSC!!!
    * All of this is in a FREE download about 14 MB in size!!!
    * We will also put up a seperate download containing a save game similar to
      the one included with TotSC that will allow you to start your game at the
      start of the most intense phase of the add-on (but if you do this, you
      will miss some of the fun).

    Tip:  Most of the cool stuff in DSotSC doesn't appear in the game until
          Chapter 5.  Once you get to Chapter 5, head over to the Friendly Arm
          Inn to find a new NPC... and a new quest...

  Again, the DSotSC is an UNofficial add-on to the game, and is not supported
  by Bioware, Black Isle, or Interplay.

  Version 2.7  September 19, 2000  536k

    Switched over to the new format, which involves a new Version History
    format (as you can see) and a new dateline at the top.  Added lots of new
    information from Scott Werner, ArtAllison, Scott Slonaker and MartectX.

    Finally Baldur's Gate II is almost out, so once I get that, I probably
    won't be updating this for a LONG while!

    Character section. Corrected an error in general strategies that made it
    look like DEX improves melee to hit; it does not. Added Josh Clue's advice
    to kill Firebead, and his alternate take on the Aldeth quest. Moved the
    walkthrough for Area N of Friendly Arm Inn to after Nashkel Mines, when it
    is a lot easier to complete. Clarified the coordinate system I use in the
    Introduction. A few dozen other small edits and fixes throughout the FAQ.

    Added a section for "Frequently Asked Questions." Finally! I've been
    playing the game again using my guide as a reference. This gives me a good
    opportunity to revise and edit everything, which is what I've been doing.
    So, there are a lot of little edits here and there. Added a new note on
    stealing stuff from Dr. Gummipress.
