Battle: Froggit
This frog monster is as easy as it gets. Just avoid his flies by staying down and move across when he lunges at you. Either compliment or threaten him to spare him.
Battle: Whimsun
You can spare this monster right away if you want to because of its shyness. Consoling it will make it flee. It will attack with butterflies that are easy to avoid by just not moving.
Battle: Moldsmal
These creatures are pretty easy. You can spare them right away for a quick battle, but feel free to flirt with them, too, to appease them. Their attacks are pretty simple to dodge.
Battle: Migosp
This bug monster is simple enough. He uses some cockroaches that attack the side of the box, so just stay in the middle. You can spare him when he's the only monster on the screen.
Battle: Loox
This one-eyed monster does not like to be picked on. Just don't pick on him to spare him. His attacks are mostly flying circles, nothing too difficult to avoid.
Battle: Vegetoid
This plant creature loves to throw fruits and veggies at you. To spare him, just select Dinner and then grab the green food he throws. You can also cut his HP down enough to Devour him, which counts as not killing him.
