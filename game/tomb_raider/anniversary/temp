\------------------/

Two rats will appear but Lara cannot kill them in any way at the moment.
Constantly avoid them.  Jump on the mine cart at the end and grab the --RED
FUSE-- inside.  There is nothing else to do here at the moment so return to the
previous area.  Try to outrun the rats so they do not follow.

Run up the stairs to the left and enter the blue building to the side.  Walk
over to the groove with the red lights and place the Red Fuse inside of the
groove.  This will make the control to the side light up with a yellow light.
Walk over to the control and press the button on it.  The crate above the other
building across from the current one will move to the left and reveal a
corridor above the building.

RETRIEVING THE GREEN FUSE

Run back down the stairs and walk over to the set of small crates right near
the stairs.  Climb on top of the small set of crates then jump to the lowest of
the large set of crates beside Lara.  Leap and grab onto the side of the higher
large crate then pull up.  Collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then fall back down
the crates.  Find the movable yellow *CRATE* on the left side of the other
building across from the one Lara just entered and move it to a side of the
building then get on top and jump to grab the side of the building then pull
up.  Walk over to the newly revealed corridor.

|                              ARTIFACT (1/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Find the two metal beams that extend from the wooden floor to the right of  |
| the corridor.  Lara can stand on these beams, so jump to the first          |
| *PERCHABLE BEAM* then to the next.  Leap over to the single *LEDGE* on the  |
| wall across from the second perchable beam then jump over to the bottom     |
| *LEDGE* on the left.  Hop up to the overhead *LEDGE* then jump across to    |
| the *POLE* behind Lara.  Jump to the *RAMP* up ahead from the pole then     |
| quickly jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the high walkway beside the ramp.  Pull |
| up and pick up the --ARTIFACT (1/4)--.  Hang off the walkway then fall down |
| and get back up on the building.                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Hop over to the corridor and follow the tunnel ahead.  Leap over the gap to the
next section of the tunnel and keep moving.  At the end, drop to the walkway
below then push the yellow *CRATE* off the side of the walkway - this will
allow Lara to get back up to this area quicker if she falls.

-- Checkpoint

Jump to the next walkway up ahead then leap over to the lowest *LEDGE* on the
opposite wall.  Hop over to the next *LEDGE* on the right then jump to grab the
overhead *LEDGE*.  On the top ledge, move to the far left then jump and grab
onto the *LEDGE* of the walkway to the left then pull up.  Run to the opposite
end and jump to the *RAMP* and slide down then quickly jump to the next walkway
near the end of the ramp.  Leap over to the next walkway to the right then
follow it to the opposite end that moves over the fence below.  Hang off the
ramp then drop to the metal structure below.  Grab the --GREEN FUSE--.

Turn around and find the *RING* below the small metal platform above.  Jump
then grapple the *RING* and begin a wall run.  At the end of the wall run,
press toward the *LEDGE* on the opposite side of the wall and press Jump at the
same time to jump toward the *LEDGE* and grab on.  Move to the right of the
ledge then jump to grab the platform on the right.  Climb up the *LADDER* on
the wall then press to the left and jump over the fence to the side the grab
the *LEDGE* that extends across the building on the other side.  Drop to the
crate below then run back to the very beginning of this area where Lara can
place the fuses.

-- Checkpoint

While inside the buildings where Lara placed the first fuse, put the green fuse
in the groove with the green lights on it.  Press the button to the side of the
green fuse to move the crate away from the opposite building.  Press the button
next to the red fuse again to move the crate close to the stack of large green
crates outside.

So the controls should look like this:

Red Fuse --> Yellow Light  -  Green Fuse --> Blue Light

RETREIVING THE BLUE FUSE

Run back down the stairs and hop up on the stack of small crates then climb up
the large green crates beside them.  On the top of the tallest green crate,
jump to grab the *LEDGE* around the side of the suspended crate then move
around to the left end.  Jump to the walkway across from the left end of the
crate.

Enter the tunnel to the left of the far end of the walkway and turn right at
the intersection and climb down the *LADDER* at that end - the tunnel straight
ahead will only lead Lara back to the very top of the area behind the fence
where she picked up the green fuse.  Run to the other end of the tunnel at the
bottom and climb down the next *LADDER*.

Lara will come to an opening overlooking a room below.  Jump to the middle
*LEDGE* on the opposite wall ahead then fall and grab onto the lower *LEDGE*
and drop once again then slide down the *RAMP* below.

-- Checkpoint

DUMPING SITE

Another pesky vermin (rat) is lurking around below so try to avoid it as much
as possible.  Find the --BLUE FUSE-- on the ground beside the pipes and poles
in the back then jump on top of the metal structure to escape the rat.  Turn
around and look at the pipes on the side of the left wall.  Jump to the lower
*PIPE* when the steam stops then wait for it to stop on the higher *PIPE* and
jump to it.  Climb to the top of the long pipe then jump on the platform to the
side.  The camera will change the second Lara hits the platform so try not to
fall at that time.

Notice the rotating metal column that is shown up ahead.  As the back portion
of the middle part rotates toward Lara, jump to grab either of the *LEDGES* on
the back of the structure.  Allow the structure to turn to the opposite side
then jump either to the right (if Lara is on the right side) or to her back (if
Lara is on the left side) and grab onto the *LEDGE* along the side of the metal
dumpster to the side.  Quickly move to the right on the metal dumpster and jump
to the next dumpster on the right since it will start to tilt downward.  Shimmy
to the right on the second dumpster then jump to the *LEDGE* on the tall metal
structure behind Lara.

Shimmy around the corner to the right and line up with the *PIPE* so that it is
to Lara's back then hop over to it when the lower steam stops.  Climb up to the
top when the steam stops at the top then quickly jump across to the high
*LEDGE* on the tall metal structure to the side - try to line Lara's back up
with the ledge (slightly to the her right a little more than behind) and jump
without pressing a direction to grab it easily.  Move to the left across the
ledge then *LEDGE* on the wall across from Lara.  Shimmy to the right and hop
up the next two *LEDGES* then pull up to the alcove above.  Turn all the way
around while in the alcove then leap back over to the tunnel where Lara
previously dropped from.

Climb up the *LADDERS* once again and take a left when the path splits at the
top.  Walk to the edge of the walkway and hang from it then fall to the floor
below.  Run back to the building with the fuses and place the Blue Fuse in the
groove with the blue lights on it.  Don't press the blue fuse button.  Press
the red fuse button move the crate outside back a bit, then press the green
fuse button to position the crate over the building across from Lara.  Finally,
press the button next to the blue fuse to drop the crate onto the roof of the
building across from Lara.

Red Fuse -> Blue Light  - Green Fuse -> Yellow Light  - Blue Fuse -> Blue Light

-- Checkpoint

FINDING THE PISTOLS

The building will shatter the rooftop.  Run down the stairs and get on top of
the yellow *CRATE* that Lara positioned below the building on the opposite
side.  Jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the side of the building then pull up and
fall into the building.  Grab the ++DUAL PISTOLS++ off the small crate in the
back.  Shoot the windows to break them then jump out through one of the
openings.  Kill the two rats if they area around.  Lara can return to the dump
site to kill the single rat if scoring every kill matters that much.

|=============================================================================|
| Since Lara now has her pistols back, return to the beginning of this level  |
| by moving down the corridor that leads back to the waterfall.  Jump into    |
| the water below.  Get on the boat then shoot the metal piece that is        |
| between the wooden piece and rope that anchors the boat.  Wait for the boat |
| to float down the stream enough so that Lara can grab the first lowest      |
| *LEDGE* on the left wall (when facing the back of the boat) then jump to    |
| grab it.  Shimmy to the right and leap across to the lower *LEDGE* on the   |
| right then hop up to the top *LEDGE*.  Jump to the *LEDGE* behind Lara then |
| move around the corner to the right.  Hop over to the *LEDGE* on the right  |
| side and move to the right then fall into the hidden alcove below.  Walk    |
| behind the first crate and grab the --ARTIFACT (2/4)--.  Dive back into the |
| water afterward.                                                            |
|                                                                             |
| (The fist ledge MUST be grabbed as the boat first moves by it.  Lara will   |
| not be given another chance since the boat moves to the far end of the      |
| tunnel.)                                                                    |

|=============================================================================|
| Swim back to the corridor behind the waterfall and follow it to the end     |
| where the pole is.  Aim at metal piece at the bottom of the ropes that hold |
| the suspended boxes then shoot the first one to make it drop and fall open. |
| The secret music will play at that time.  The second crate holds nothing.   |
| Return to the bottom and walk up to the other side of the crate then        |
| collect the --CHALICE OF TORMENT RELIC (1/1)--.  Lara can still use the     |
| ropes that were holding the crates to swing back to the area above the      |
| waterfall.  Return to the area with the fuse building once again.           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Follow the tracks back to the area with the mine cart (where the first Red Fuse
was at).

-- Checkpoint

Near the mine cart, shoot the windows of the metal building above.  Climb on
top of the metal crate on the right side of the building then jump to grab the
*LEDGE* that extends across the lower portion of the building and move to the
left.  Pull up into the building then press the +BUTTON+ on the far side of the
control panel.  This will move the mine cart over to the side and position the
drill cart onto the tracks.  Fall back down and get on the back of the drill
cart then press the action button for a cutscene.

Interactive Cutscene: R1 - R1 - R1

Lara will automatically get the ++BLUE FUSE++ back directly after the cutscene.
Be sure to pick up the ++SHOTGUN++ lying next to the body.

-- Checkpoint

Run up the stairs toward the building with the fuses.  Place the blue fuse in
its slot once again and use the button next to it to raise the crate blocking
the outside railroad track.  Run back outside and get on the drill cart once
again then start it again to continue onward.  Allow the drill cart to drill
through the boards at the end of the track.  Follow the railroad tracks to the
end.

-- Checkpoint

LAVA ROOM

Jump to the pillar platform on the left.  Turn around on the pillar platform
and look for the guns on the rock in the lava below the side that Lara just
jumped from.  In order to get these, hang off the side of pillar that faces
away from the rock then drop and grab the *LEDGE* on the side of the pillar.
Shimmy to the left then jump to the very small *PERCHABLE METAL PIECE* in the
lava to the right of the rock - this metal piece in blends in very well with
the lava.  Hop over to the rock from the metal piece and pick up the ++DUAL 50
CALIBER PISTOLS++.

Leap back over to the metal piece then jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the side of
the pillar once again.  Move around the right side then jump and grab the
*COLUMN* across from Lara.  From the column, position Lara's back to the
*PERCHABLE METAL PIECE* beside her then jump to it - it is across from a ramp.
Leap over to the *LEDGE* near the bottom of the metal pillar to the side then
move around the left corner and jump to grab the overhead *LEDGE* then leap
over to the metal pillar behind Lara.

-- Checkpoint

Jump and grapple the *RING* on the outstretched metal platform up ahead.  Swing
then jump to the *RAMP* up ahead and quickly jump to the *POLE* across from the
ramp.  The pole will turn to the side as Lara grabs on.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| While on the pole, turn around and face the opposite direction.  Swing then |
| jump over to the rock with the shiny objects to collect a ++SMALL           |
| MEDIPACK++ and an --ARTIFACT (3/4)--.  Lara will just barely make this      |
| jump.  Hop across the two *PERCHABLE METAL PIECES* in the lava then jump to |
| the *RAMP* once and leap back to the pole - it will have swung back in      |
| place.                                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump to the *RAMP* ahead then quickly jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* on the
metal pillar across from the ramp.  Jump up the next *LEDGE* then leap to the
top of the pillar and pull up.  Turn to the right to spot a *RING* on the
ceiling above.  Jump then grapple the *RING* on the ceiling and swing then jump
over to the tracks with the shiny object.  Pick up the ++MINI SMG AMMO++,
another ++MINI SMG AMMO++ pickup, and a ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Jump and grapple
the same *RING* once again then swing back across to the top of the metal
pillar.  Jump to the side with the tracks up ahead then follow the tunnel.

-- Checkpoint

Jump on the rock *RAMP* to the right then grab onto the *LEDGE* of the rock
above.  Pull up then climb up the next two rock platforms up above.  Turn to
the right and jump to the lowest rock platform on the other side.  Jump to grab
the *LEDGE* of the rock platform on the left then pull up.  Turn to the left
and look for the rock *RAMP* on the left and jump to it then jump again to land
on the high floor above and a cutscene will trigger.

Interactive Cutscene: O - R1 - X

-- Checkpoint

Pick up the ++DUAL MINI SMGs++ from the obvious body.

TIP: Once the Dual Mini SMGs are collected this will activate another
checkpoint, so some of the below obstacles can be done before activating this
check point in order to keep Lara from performing them again if she dies!  Save
after this checkpoint since the last Artifact can be missed easily.

-- Checkpoint

Find the yellow *CRATE* on the right side then push it over below the rocks to
the right of pyramid.  Get on top of the crate then jump to the rocks above.
Climb and run around the left side to find a hidden ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ in the
back right of this area.  Fall back down the rocks.

Run over to the left side of the front portion of the pyramid and find the
other yellow *CRATE* and position it far left set of rocks.  Climb on top of
the lowest rock structure then jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the rock wall ahead
then jump and pull up to the top of the rock platform with the ramp to the
side.  Hop up to the next *LEDGE* on the wall ahead then shimmy around the
right corner.  Jump to the right flat portion above the ramp.  Rotate the
camera on this spot to see some items in a hidden alcove to Lara's left.  Jump
to the sloped portion of the left side of the pyramid then quickly leap to the
alcove - Lara can also fall along the side of the wall (in between the wall and
the pyramid) and leap to the ramp then leap up into the alcove.  Pick up the
++MINI SMG AMMO++ the other ++MINI SMG AMMO++ and a ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Move
back around the side and hop up the *LEDGES* then leap back over to the flat
rock portion of the ramp.  Hop up to the *CREVICE* on the left wall then jump
up to the top and pull up.

From this side, Lara must leap across the metal spires on the side of the
pyramid.  The spires with glowing markings on the side of them will sink into
the pyramid once Lara leaps to one of them.  Lara must leap to a total of six
++GLOWING MARK SPIRES++ in order to open the pyramid doors below.

Below is a diagram with numbers of the order that they can jumped on in order
to perform it all in one run and get the ARTIFACT at the other end:

(Please note that there are two sets of numbers (1-12 and 1-9))

|       = Perchable Spire
numbers = order to jump on them

(some of spires are leaped to more than once, hence the 47 below)

|=============================================================================|
| Once Lara reaches the far right side of the pyramid (the 2nd #9 on the      |
| diagram), she must jump to the last spire with markings then quickly jump   |
| to grab the *LEDGE* on the side of the rock hill up ahead.  Shimmy around   |
| to the left side then jump to the flat portion of the rock.  Pull up to the |
| top area and collect the ARTIFACT (4/4).  The jump from the spire must be   |
| performed the first time since it will sink in afterwards.  Once the spire  |
| is sunk in, the only way to get this is to reload your save.  Lara can get  |
| it at the beginning of the next stage, but it will not count then.          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once all six of the spires have been activate all the markings on the bottom
door will light up.  Lara has to use the remaining spires and jump back to the
top alcove in order to pull the *SWITCH* inside.

Slide back down the pyramid and enter the corridor through the newly opened
doors.  Pick up the ++MINI SMG AMMO++ along the way.

INCUBATION ROOM

Lara will eventually reach a room with a reddish tint along the side and plenty
of lit up markings along the wall and floors.  The red portion of the walls are
actually holding up eggs along the walls.  The door to the left is sealed so
run to the back of the room and collect the ++MINI SMG AMMO++ along with
another ++MINI SMG AMMO+ from behind the far right pillar.  Enter the next room
through the doorway ahead.

A cutscene will play as Lara enters the next room.  Lara will start out in the
room behind her a gargoyle and a jackal burst forth from the eggs along the
walls and attack Lara.

-- Checkpoint

Fire at the gargoyle and kill him quickly since his fireballs can be very
deadly - literally pinning Lara down.  The jackals are much like the mummified
jackals in Egypt.

Lara cannot do anything on the ledge where the cutscene took place so don't go
back there.  Walk back to the end of the current room and go through the newly
opened door on the right.  Follow the corridor behind it and climb the *LADDER*
to the very top.  Walk into the next room up ahead.

TOP OF INCUBATION ROOM

Two gargoyles will burst forth from the eggs in the room below and attack Lara.
Stay against the wall and kill them quickly.  Grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from
the right side of the walkway then the other ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ and the ++DUAL
MINI SMG AMMO++ from the middle portion of the walkway.  Run to the opposite
side of the room and find the doorway on the right.  Follow the corridor behind
the doorway.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (SECOND FLOOR)

Lara will emerge on a higher ledge in the lava room where the last cutscene
took place.  Look to the left and collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++, ++SHOTGUN
AMMO++ and ++MINI SMG AMMO++.

Look to the right to spot a *BUTTON* in the middle of the right wall.  This
button will extend a *RING* up above it when shot enough times so that the
markings around it light up, but it will also release a gargoyle from its egg
the first time after being activated, so deal with the gargoyle then shoot it
again.

This part is timed so all of the following must be done very quickly after
shooting the button.  In order to pass this part, after shooting the button
enough times, quickly jump to the grab the *CREVICE* on the right then shimmy
around the left corner.  Jump and grapple the *RING* then wall run and jump to
the lower *CREVICE* on the opposite side.  Hop up to the higher *CREVICE* then
move to the right and jump to the platform above and pull up on top of it.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (THIRD FLOOR)

All is quiet until Lara shoots the *BUTTON* on the right wall.  Another
gargoyle will attack her once she shoots it so be ready.  Shoot the button some
more to extend another *RING* up above.

Quickly jump to the lower *CREVICE* then the higher *CREVICE* and shimmy to the
left.  Jump toward the overhead *RING* on the wall then grapple it and wall run
then jump to the lower *CREVICE* on the other side followed by the higher
*LEDGE*.  Move to the right then jump to the next overhead *CREVICE* then leap
to the next platform behind Lara and pull up.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (FOURTH FLOOR)

Notice the three eggs on the wall.  Get a heavier weapon than the Pistols ready
because when Lara shoots the *BUTTON* on the right wall two gargoyles will
attack.  Don't fight them with the pistols alone - there is no reason to horde
ammo - and make sure to stay moving so Lara doesn't fall off the platform by
getting hit.

Shoot the *BUTTON* again so that the markings light up then notice that three
*POLES* extend from the wall to the right - two are right beside the platform
that Lara is on and the other is further ahead on the right wall.  A *RING*
also extends from the far right wall and another *RING* extends from the wall
directly ahead.

Start off by jumping to the *RAMP* on the pillar to the right then jump to the
lower *POLE* next to the platform that Lara is on and swing then jump
immediately to the next *POLE* on the first swing then turn to face the
opposite direction very quickly while on the pole.  Hold the opposite direction
while swinging on the pole and Lara will automatically change her swinging
direction.  Swing one time then jump and grab onto the *CREVICE* on the pillar
against the wall.  Quickly shimmy to the left on the crevice then jump to grab
the *POLE* across from Lara.  Swing one time on the pole then jump and grapple
to the overhead *RING* on the ceiling.  Wall run to the opposite end then press
to the left along with the jump button right before Lara turns around and
grapple the next *RING* on the wall to the left.  Wall run to the pillar ahead
and jump to grab the lower *CREVICE* on the pillar then jump to the next
*CREVICE* and shimmy to the left. Hop over to the next platform from the top
crevice.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (FIFTH FLOOR)

There is a *BUTTON* on the wall ahead.  Shoot it and two gargoyles will attack
as expected.  Fight them off then quickly shoot the button again to extend the
platform that Lara is on.  The platform will constantly try to move back into
the wall at a very slow pace, but Lara will fall if the platform is left
unattended.  The button will cause two poles to extend forth from the wall to
the side.  This timed run is not as hard as the last, but it must be done fast
since the timer ticks down at a quicker rate than the past timed runs.

Shoot the *BUTTON* then jump to the *RAMP* on the pillar to the side.  At the
end of the ramp, jump to the *POLE* up ahead then quickly swing to the next
*RAMP*.  Jump to the next *POLE* before reaching the end of the next ramp then
quickly swing then jump to the lower *CREVICE* on the pillar across from Lara.
Leap up to the overhead *CREVICE* then shimmy around the left side of the
pillar.  Jump to grab the side of the next platform then pull up.

TALL LAVA ROOM (SIXTH FLOOR)

Shoot the next *BUTTON* on the wall then fight off the two gargoyles that
attack.  The platform will continue to move into the wall like the last one
once the button has been shot once.  Shoot the button again and notice that a
*RING* moves out of the wall on the same wall as the button and another *RING*
move out on the wall to the side of the other.

Jump to the *RAMP* of the pillar to the side then quickly jump and grapple the
overhead *RING* and wall run then jump to the next *RAMP*.  Jump then grapple
the next *RING* while sliding to the end of the ramp then wall run and jump to
grab the lower *CREVICE* on the pillar ahead.  Hop up to the next *CREVICE*
then shimmy to the left and jump to the next platform.

TALL LAVA ROOM (SEVENTH FLOOR)

Grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the platform
up above.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/1)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Notice the *CREVICE* on the pillar to the side of the door.  Jump to grab   |
| the *CREVICE* then move to the left until Lara is below a secret alcove to  |
| the side of the pillar.  Climb up into the alcove and collect the           |
| --ARTIFACT (1/1)--.  Do not try to hang off the side and shimmy back across |
| since a gargoyle will pop out of the overhead egg and attack, just jump     |
| back to the platform from the alcove and quickly defeat the gargoyle.       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Follow the corridor ahead.  Lara will stumble upon many traps in her path.  Be
sure to grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ and other ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ to the left past
the first small pillar Perform a timed run to get through all the blades and
fireballs up ahead.  For the first set of fireballs, wait for them to shoot
then quickly run and grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then roll back.

-- Checkpoint

Walk up to the end of the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH CENTRAL DAIS/DOPPELGANGER ROOM

Take out Lara's pistols and fire them to notice something on the far side of
the opposite end of the room ahead.  This strange figure fires whenever Lara
fires.  Drop down the *RAMP* and slide into the room below.

Three jackals will burst out of the eggs on the lower floor of the room and
attack.  Blast the jackals but be sure not to aim at the other thing that moves
around the around the room.  Once the jackals are dead, turn toward the figure
to see that it is a doppelganger of Lara.  It will fire whenever Lara fires and
mimic whatever Lara does.  The room is mirrored, so the doppelganger will climb
as Lara climbs.  Walk behind the two large pillars found along the sides of the
room and collect the two ++MINI SMG AMMOS++.

Rotate the central *DAIS* in the middle of the room - Lara's doppelganger will
help to turn it faster.  Two platforms will extend out from the bottom of two
sets of ladders mounted on the walls.  Jump toward the platform below the
ladder to the right of the side that Lara entered and pull up then climb the
*LADDER*.  Jump to the right and grab the *CREVICE* then quickly jump to the
walkway at the top to avoid the flames that spread out of the crevice - these
types of crevices will burn Lara's hands and make her let go once the flames
spread out.

Lara will land on a circular trapdoor and the doppelganger will land on a
*PRESSURE SWITCH* on the other walkway that will cause the door up ahead to
seal shut.  Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ while moving to the back of the
walkway then blast the gargoyle as it pops out of the egg up above.  Grab the
++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from the other side then pull the *SWITCH* on the
wall.  The switch will make the trapdoor open up to reveal a tube of lava below
it.

The trapdoor to the lava tube is timed, so perform this next part quickly.
Directly after pressing the switch, hang off the side of the walkway then drop
to the floor below.  Rotate the *DAIS* in the middle of the room then climb up
the opposite platform and *LADDER* than the one Lara came from.  Jump to grab
the *CREVICE* on the right then quickly jump toward the circular *PRESSURE
SWITCH* on the walkway to Lara's back.  This will cause the doppelganger to
jump into the lava tube on the opposite and kill her in the process.  A
cutscene will play once the doppelganger is defeated.

Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then run to the end of the walkway.  Another
gargoyle will bust out of the egg on the wall to the side, so blast it.
Collect the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the other end of the walkway.  This next part
is not timed like the first switch pulling was.

Pull the *SWITCH* on the wall to the side to open the door on the walkway
across from Lara.  Do not step on the *PRESSURE SWITCH* at the opposite end of
the walkway or the door will close.  This door will lead Lara out of the
current room.  Hang off the side of the current walkway then fall to the floor
below.  Run over to the *DAIS* and rotate it once again - it takes longer
without the doppelganger.  Grab onto the platform and ascend the *LADDER* on
the opposite side, jump to grab the *CREVICE* then jump on the *PRESSURE
SWITCH* above.  The pressure switch will not close the door now that the
doppelganger is dead.  Run through the doorway at the opposite end and follow
the corridor.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH HORIZONTAL PILLARS

Lara will emerge in a room with lava in the middle and a door across from her.
Each of the side areas contains a switch that will help Lara to reach the door
across in the middle.

Walk over to the right side and study the movements of the three pillars.  Lara
must run and jump across the three pillars right when they extend from the
wall.  Perform the first jump right as the pillars move out of the wall then
hold forward and keep tapping the jump button.  This will get Lara to other
side safely.  Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then pull the *SWITCH* to open the
middle doorway.

-- Checkpoint

A gargoyle will burst out of one of the eggs along the walls above the lava and
attack.  Kill him then hop back across the three pillars the save that Lara
made it before.

Approach the second set of three pillars on the left side.  Notice that the
spaces of the walkways in the pillars path have glowing marks trailing to the
end of the walkway.  In order to pass these, run past each one and stand in one
of the two spaces in between them that does not have any glowing markings.
Hold the walk button (R2) to move more precisely.  Touching the sides will not
damage Lara, so just walk against them to speed up the walking process a bit.
Walk over to the *SWITCH* on the other side and pull it to extend a bridge
across the middle portion of the area that leads to the doorway.

-- Checkpoint

Like clockwork, another gargoyle will burst from an egg below and attack Lara.
Walk past the pillars once again and move to the bridge.

|=============================================================================|
| While standing in the middle of the bridge, aim at the dark *ROCK* on the   |
| ceiling above the doorway up ahead and shoot it.  The rock will fall down   |
| and crash through the floor in front of the doorway up ahead.  Walk to the  |
| edge of this new opening and fall down inside.  Lara will hit a *RAMP* and  |
| start to slide downward toward the lava.  Jump and grapple the *RING* on    |
| the bottom side of the bridge above.  Swing on the grapple then jump to the |
| tunnel that contains the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.                                |
|                                                                             |
| Move further into the tunnel (to the left) and climb the *LADDER* on the    |
| wall.  Pick up the --TORC OF EMBITTERMENT RELIC-- from the top area.  Jump  |
| into the circular opening to the right then fall out the other side of the  |
| opening to land back on the floor above once again.                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Cross the bridge and pass through the doorway in the middle (jump over the gap
if Lara went after the relic) then keep moving to end the level.

Walk forward and enter the room up ahead for a cutscene.

===============================================================================
----------------------------> Boss - Abomination <-----------------------------

Immediately after the cutscene, Lara will be thrown into battle with a giant
creature on the floor below.

Most of this boss' attacks are close range, so make sure to keep some distance
between him and Lara and she'll only have to worry about the beast's ground
pound attacks.  He will sometimes lift up the back end of his body and slam it
down into the floor.  Lara must jump or dodge to the side at that exact moment
to avoid taking damage.  From up close, he will try to slap Lara with both of
his arms.  If his right hand ever grabs Lara he will either toss her away from
him or put her in his mouth and try to digest her.  The digestion attack is
escapable by pressing the R1 button while Lara is in the beast's stomach.  Lara
will shoot his head and jump out.

Just like any other boss, he has a life bar along with a rage bar.  The room
that Lara fights him in has three walls and a pit on fourth side away from the
door with lava at the bottom.  Shoot the boss in the head to fill his rage bar
and stand with Lara's back against the end with the pit.  When he charges, and
the screen blur, dodge to the side and shoot him when the targeting crosshairs
turn red.  This will cause him to tump over and slide off the side toward the
pit.  A cutscene will play where he will grab on with his left hand.  No matter
how much Lara shoots his right hand, he will manage to pull himself back up to
the floor above.  He will jump into the air while pulling himself back up and
come down with a ground pound, so be ready to jump or dodge to the side.  Lara
MUST knock him off once in order to perform the procedure below.

Shoot him some more to fill his rage bar then perform another adrenaline shot
while dodging out of the way.  Keep him away from the pit.  He use his left
hand in an attempt to smash Lara and will get his left hand stuck in the floor.
Target his left hand and shoot at it until it breaks apart.  He will slam his
right hand into the floor a total of three times while his left hand is stuck
so Lara must either jump or dodge to the side during each ground pound - try to
keep shooting at these times.

In order for him to swing with his left hand once again, Lara must knock him
off the side of the pit again.  He will lift himself back up, but afterwards he
will try to hit Lara again with his left hand after his rage meter is filled -
destroy his left hand even further at this time.  Lara must tear apart his left
hand in this way a total of two times - two cutscenes with his hand falling
apart.  If he ever keeps attacking Lara with his right hand while his rage
meter is filled then knock him off the side again to tire out his right hand so
he will use his left hand.

Once his left hand has been destroyed, he will no longer get it stuck in the
floor after being stunned, so once again, put Lara's back to the pit side of
the room and shoot the creature to fill his rage bar.  Dodge out of the way and
shoot him when he runs at Lara then target his right hand while it maintains
its grip along the side of the floor and fire at it.  If Lara has destroyed his
left hand completely then the boss will loose his grip and fall into the lava
below, ending the fight.

During the battle, there are two ++LARGE MEDIPACKS++ (front sides of room),
some ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ (in front of door), and two ++MINI SMG AMMOS++ (back
sides of room) lying around the room - these can be collected after the battle
also.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

ROOM WITH LAVA FLOW

Once the boss is dead, the door at the front of the room will open.  Run down
the corridor past the door to reach a lava river.  Jump to the flat rock in the
lava then to the second and grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the second rock.
Leap to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in the lava further ahead then hop over to the
next *PERCHABLE COLUMN* to the left.  Jump to the *LEDGE* of the platform up
ahead and pull up fast since an egg will burst open on the wall up ahead and a
gargoyle will attack.  Move forward a bit while shooting it and keep moving to
the sides so Lara doesn't fall into the lava.

Pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall to make the platform ahead extend outward.
The smaller platform that Lara is currently on will start to move into the left
wall.  Jump to the larger platform when it extends out fully and grab the
*LEDGE* along the side and pull up.  Run into the corridor to the right as the
larger platform starts to move back in place.  Pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++
along the way and keep following the corridor.  An artifact can be seen in a
high alcove but it cannot be retrieved at the moment.  Continue on into the
next room.  A Centaurs will make a violent dash at Lara from the next room as
she turns the last corner so be ready to shoot and dodge.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH TWO LAVA POOLS

Walk over to the closed door on the left side of the room and pick up the
++LARGE MEDIPACK++ and ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Approach the *SWITCH* on the far wall
and pull it to close the door that Lara just came through and open the door to
the side.  This will also cause a gargoyle to burst out of one of the eggs on
the side wall.  Blast the gargoyle and enter through the newly opened door.

-- Checkpoint

POOL ROOM

As Lara reaches the bottom of the ramp that leads to the next room, a jackal
and a gargoyle will burst forth from the eggs on the sidewalls then attack
Lara.  Collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the
back of the room after the battle.  Jump into the middle pool and find the
*LEVER* on the wall then pull it to make a platform extend out of the wall
below a hidden tunnel on wall above.

Swim back to the surface and climb up to the platform below the opening.  A
jackal will burst out of an egg right next to the platform so pull on up to the
platform and shoot him from there.  Hop up into the opening and pick up the
++LARGE MEDIPACK++ inside.  Climb to the opening above with the metal *CAGE*.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Look behind Lara to spot an artifact on a high ledge across from the        |
| opening.  Jump to the ledge and pull up then collect the --ARTIFACT (1/4)-- |
| and jump back.                                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Push the *CAGE* off the other end of the opening and allow it to fall into the
first room with the lava.  Fall down into the room and position the *CAGE*
below the rock pillar.

-- Checkpoint

FINDING THE FIRST STONE PANEL

Climb on top of the *CAGE* then pull up to the rock pillar.  A gargoyle will
burst out of the egg up above and attack so quickly shoot him before he starts
tossing fireballs.  Grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ on top of the rock pillar.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Hop up to the metal platform to the side and pull the *SWITCH* to make the  |
| door below Lara reopen.  Pull or push the *CAGE* into the corridor and      |
| position below the artifact in the alcove that was visible while moving     |
| down this corridor earlier.  Climb up to the alcove and grab the --ARTIFACT |
| (2/4)--.  Position the *CAGE* below the same rock pillar once again and hop |
| back up to the top of the rock pillar.                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump and grab the first of the three *LEDGES* above the small pool of lava and
move to the left then jump to the other two *LEDGES* quickly.  These crevices
will shoot out a flame and fry Lara's hands then make her fall if she holds
onto any of them for too long so move fast!  Jump to the *LEDGE* on the pillar
to the far left after moving across the third heated *LEDGE*.  Move around the
left side of the pillar then jump and grapple the *RING* on the wall behind
Lara and wall run then jump to the *CREVICE* on the rock wall above the lava.
Shimmy to the left on the crevice and jump up to the opening up above it.  Pull
up and collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from inside the opening.

Walk to the other end of the opening and drop to the sloped portion below.
Pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ to the right then drop into the room up ahead.
Lara will land back in the room with the pool but she will be behind the set of
rocks that was on the right side.  Turn around and find the stone panel on the
wall to the right.  Jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* on the central portion of
the stone panel to drag it downward.  Fall off of the stone panel then quickly
turn and shoot the *BUTTON* that is revealed behind the top portion of the
panel.  This will remove one of the gates blocking the pipe inside of the
middle pool.  Jump to the flat rock behind Lara then leap over the stack of
rocks to get out of this area.

FINDING THE LAST TWO PANELS

The last two panels are in the room with the pool (look on the back walls) the
left panel is out in the open, but the right panel is above a pit of lava so be
careful when shooting the *BUTTON* above each one.  A gargoyle will burst out
of an egg once the button on the left side is shot.

-- Checkpoint

Once the remaining two buttons are shot, the pipe below will be fully open, so
jump into the water and swim through the new opening.  Grab the ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ along the way then pick up the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ upon
pulling up from the pool.

-- Checkpoint

LAVA FLOW AREA

A slight tremor will hint that this area isn't very stable.  Jump over the
right side of the first lava river to land on the rock section between the
river.  Be wary of the lava drops that fall from the ceiling since they can
damage Lara.  Leap to the next rock section on the left then move around the
corner to the left.

Notice the ladder on the right wall up ahead.  Jump to the *LADDER* on the
right wall then climb to the very top.  Leap over to the *LEDGE* on the left
then quickly jump to the *LEDGE* above before the flames shoot out from the
side of the current ledge and move to the right before the fire burst out from
the hole below the higher ledge.  Stay in between the falling pieces of lava
drops and the fire burst hole.

Jump and grab the next *LEDGE* above and quickly jump to the left and grab the
safe *LEDGE* on the left pillar.  Jump to the next *LEDGE* on the pillar to the
left connected to the opposite wall.  Don't touch the Lava flow to the left or
Lara dies!  Drop to the small *LEDGE* below the current one and pull up then
collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the small platform above.  Hang off the side
of the platform once again then fall and grab onto the lower *LEDGE*.  Move to
the left just enough so that Lara can get her feet on the wall then hop over to
the *LEDGE* on the pillar across from the current ledge.  Fall down to the
lower *LEDGE* below then fall to the rock ground at the bottom.

The two rock pieces in the lava will sink as Lara jumps to them.  Jump to the
first then to the second.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| While on the second rock piece in the middle of the lava river, turn to the |
| right and jump to the hidden rock piece beside the lava fall - this rock    |
| piece will not sink like the others.  Jump to the rock walkway behind the   |
| lava fall and grab the --ARTIFACT (3/4)-- from the very back.  Jump back to |
| the rock piece beside the lava fall then jump back to the sinking rock      |
| piece.                                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Turn to the left (up ahead for those that got the artifact) while on the second
rock piece and leap then grab the lower *LEDGE* on the rock wall to the side of
the rock piece.  Jump to the overhead *LEDGE* and shimmy around the left corner
but don't move to the far left since lava drops are falling on above that
portion of the ledge.

Look away from the ledge to spot a perchable column across from the ledge.
Leap over to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN*.  Notice that the a flame burst forth from
the hole on the right wall every few seconds, so wait until it stops then jump
to the next *PERCHABLE COLUMN* then leap over to the long *POLE* up ahead.
Swing on the pole then jump to the rock piece in the lava then quickly jump to
the rock floor ahead before the rock piece sinks into the lava.

Turn to the left and jump to the rock piece then quickly hop onto the *LADDER*
on the rock wall ahead before the rock piece sinks.  Climb to the very top of
the ladder then pull up to the area above.  Walk a few steps ahead to activate
a checkpoint.  I recommend this checkpoint before trying for the artifact since
it has been quite a while since the last checkpoint.

-- Checkpoint

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (4/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn around once the checkpoint is activated and look on the ceiling above  |
| to spot a ring above the ladder.  Jump and grapple to the *RING* then swing |
| and jump over to the raised portion of the rock floor above - look for the  |
| flame shooting forth from the wall.  Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from    |
| the side of the flame current then walk to the ledge in the back.  Hop over |
| to the first rock platform and collect yet another ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then  |
| jump into the alcove to the right of that rock platform and grab the        |
| --ARTIFACT (4/4)--.  Hop back across the rock platform and swing back to    |
| the other side.                                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Walk through the doorway and enter the room ahead for a cutscene.

===============================================================================
----------------------> Boss Battle - Natla (round 1) <------------------------

Once the cutscene comes to a close, Lara will immediately be attacked by Natla.
Natla will fly to around the various portions of the room and shoot three
fireballs at a time downward upon Lara.  Stay at a distance from Natla and the
fireballs can dodged much easier since Lara will have more time to react by
jumping to the side or dodging.  Lara can also get behind a pillar to avoid the
fireballs.  Natla will also dive down at Lara and try to kick her when Lara
gets to close.  Crouch or perform a well-timed roll in order to avoid the
lunging kick.

Natla will teleport to different portions of the room so Lara will have to find
her frequently.  Aim for Natla's wings and fire at them to slowly drain her
health.  The cursor will usually highlight Natla's head, so manually switch to
a single wing.  Use the Dual Mini SMGs to finish this part of the battle
quickly.

There are three ++MINI SMG AMMO++ pickups and one ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ pickup in
this area.  Once half of Natla's life bar has been drained, another cutscene
will take place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
----------------------> Boss Battle - Natla (round 2) <------------------------

Natla will settle mainly for fireball attacks during this round.  Be sure to
stay at a distance from her since she will shoot out three fireballs more
rapidly at this time.  Lara can still get behind a pillar to avoid the
fireballs but it is best to stay out in the open and dodge them in order to hit
Natla while avoiding them.  Notice that Natla has a rage bar for this round.
Fire at Natla with the pistols to increase her rage bar.  The Shotgun really
helps at this stage since it will build her rage bar at an incredible rate per
shot depending on how close Lara is to Natla.

Once Natla is angered (full rage bar), she will charge at Lara and try to slice
Lara with one of her wings.  Dodge directly toward Natla as the screen blurs
and shoot the green stone on her back as the crosshairs turn red while Lara is
somersaulting over her - run at her and dodge aggressively.  Natla will be
stunned if Lara hits her directly in the green stone on her back, so take that
chance to shoot her in the green stone and drain her life.  Natla will only
allow Lara to take a certain amount of health no matter what weapon Lara uses
then her rage bar will instantly fall and she will go back to shooting
fireballs.  If Lara happens to miss the green stone then Natla will give her
plenty more chances while her rage bar drains since Natla will constantly
teleport away then dash at Lara again to perform another wing attack.

This is the final battle of the game so use any ammo or health items needed to
win the battle.  The Shotgun really helps out a bunch during this battle so
don't be afraid to use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Once Natla has been defeated, a cutscene will take place.

(Be sure to enable "Subtitles" from the "Options" menu under the pause menu for
the full experience in Croft Manor.  Some of the books contain clues that will
be in all caps in the subtitles.)

LIVING ROOM

Lara will begin her adventure in the living room of Croft Manor after reading
the note from her butler, Winston, in the beginning cutscene.  Start out by
examining the book in front of Lara (from the other side of the table).

"And even as their hooves shook the earth beneath them, Gilead gathered his
remaining strength and drew back his BOW."
-- The Trials of Gilead, Volume I

This is actually a clue the main puzzle in Croft Manor.  Lara can examine many
of these open books throughout the manor, and read a phrase from them.  After
examining most of them, she will mention "I've already read this one" when
attempting to read it again, but for special books that offer clues such as
this first book, she will always read the book upon examination.

Directly across from the bottom of the staircase, there is a *PRESSURE PLATE*
that will reveal an arrow behind a secret panel in the back of the fireplace
when stepped on.  Find the *CRATE* with red labels in the back of the stack of
crates to the side and pull it over on top of the *PRESSURE PLATE*.  Don't try
to get the arrow yet, or the fire will burn Lara.

-- Checkpoint

Walk back over to the stack of crates and climb to the top of the right set of
crates.  Turn to the left at the very top and jump to grab the top of the big
painting that forms a *LEDGE* and shimmy across it to the left.  Jump to the
left stack of crates then find the item on that side.  Collect the --SCULPTURE
GEAR++ then grab back onto the painting and fall on the tallest set of crates
to land safely.

Run up the main staircase.  Standing in the middle of the stairs and facing the
vase, the first door on the right leads to the Gallery Room, but it is locked
due to the security system, the second door leads to the Music Room, which is
the main goal for this level (it's locked).  The first door on the left leads
to the Library and the second door leads to Lara's Room.

Start by entering the first door on the left.  The hall will take Lara to the
Library.  Along the way Lara can find a few open books as mentioned earlier.

LIBRARY

The door will lock behind Lara as she enters and she cannot get out from this
room.  Find the *RED BOOK* on the middle left bookcase that stands out from the
rest and push it to make the bookcase to the right slide open and reveal a
hidden alcove.  Pick up the --MAZE MAP-- from the hidden alcove.

-- Checkpoint

Run up the stairs to the side.  A silver elephant will be visible in a glass
display at the top - this is actually one of the artifacts for the manor, but
Lara can't retrieve it just yet.  Enter the room on the other side of the
second floor.  Read the middle open book to the right inside of the room for
another clue about the main puzzle in the mansion.

"As he struggled mightily to calm himself, Gilead removed the poison ARROW from
its quiver."
-- The Trials of Gilead, Volume II

Find the two *RED BOOKS* that stick out from the bookcases in the back of the
room and press both of them to make the middle bookcase slide into the wall and
reveal another hidden alcove.  Retrieve the ++DUAL PISTOLS++ from the alcove.

-- Checkpoint

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Walk back out of the room and shoot the glass case with the silver elephant |
| then grab the --ARTIFACT (1/8)-- (the elephant).                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Find the painting across from the side of the second floor with no railing and
jump to the grab the top portion, the *LEDGE*, at the top.  The painting will
slide down and a button will become visible.  Jump off the painting to land
back on the second floor then quickly shoot the *BUTTON* to make the wall slide
back below and reveal a hidden entrance.

-- Checkpoint

Walk down to the floor below and enter this hidden corridor.

SECRET PASSAGE

Walk through the corridor until a stack of crates appear down the hall ahead.
Look to the left of the stack of crates and pick up the --EMPTY BUCKET-- from
the bottom shelf.  The crates can be destroyed with Lara's guns so shoot them
out of the way or just hop over them and continue down the corridor.  Lara will
reach a closed door at the other end, but press the *BUTTON* on the left wall
to open the door.

-- Checkpoint

GALLERY

This room contains all the relics that Lara has found throughout her
adventures.  If all the relics have been found then they will be displayed in
the surrounding glass cases.  Run up the stairs to the right and enter the room
on the opposite wall.  Examine the book on the far right end to the left.

"The concept of the sundial has existed for thousands of years and is one of
the earliest devices for time measurement.  (Lara) There's some numbers written
on the inside cover.  11, 2, 7.  I wonder what they refer to?"

Shoot the right glass display and pick up the --SUNDIAL GNOMON--.

-- Checkpoint

Leave the room and run back downstairs.  Examine the red *SECURITY LIGHT* on
the door to unlock it.  Walk out into the hall ahead and follow it to the end
to return to the second floor of the Living Room.  Walk across the stairs and
enter the second room on the left.  Follow the hall then open the door at the
end to enter Lara's Room

LARA'S ROOM

On the right side of this room is Lara's dressing room where she can change
into any of her unlocked outfits that she received from finding relics in other
levels.

Turn to the left upon entering the room and pull both sword *SWITCHES* on the
side pedestals to make the gorgon head open to reveal Lara's ++JOURNAL++.  Read
the open book to the right for the final clue to the main manor puzzle.

"And Gilead knew the GEARS of his heart would never turn again as he sacrificed
his one true love to save the kingdom he fought so long to protect."
-- The Trials of Gilead, Volume III

Everything else in Lara's room is optional material (open books) that has
nothing to do with the level, so exit the room and return to the Living Room.

-- Checkpoint

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

Walk down the stairs and stand facing away from the stairs at the bottom.  The
first room on the left leads to the Gym, the second room on the left leads to
the Pool Room, and the room up the small staircase to the right (in the back)
leads to the Garden Maze.  Open the door up the small staircase in the back
right and follow the corridor to the end.

GARDEN MAZE

Through the next door, Lara will enter the corridor at the front of the Garden
Maze.  Take the first left in the corridor - Lara can't fix the water system at
the moment further ahead.  Walk up to the Sundial and place the Sundial Gnomon
from earlier on the front of it.  This will activate the Sundial and allow Lara
to move it.

Move the sundial toward the following numbers found in the book from earlier:

--> 11, 2, 7

or

--> XI, II, VII

The dual shock controller will vibrate as the sundial points to each number and
a chime will confirm the correct number.  The gate to the Garden Maze will open
once the sequence is complete.

-- Checkpoint

Enter the Garden Maze.  The camera angle will zoom in to show Lara's Grapple on
the opposite end of the gate up ahead.  Lara needs to venture through the
garden maze in order to make her way to it from one of the other entrances.
There are also three artifacts in the maze - one in the southeast (look for the
target symbol on the map), one in the southwest (plus symbol), and one in the
north (middle block with four surrounding circles).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn right at the beginning then follow the trail until a split.  Take the  |
| right path and follow it all the way to an open area with grass in the      |
| middle. Enter the left path and follow it then take the first left followed |
| by the next right.  Pick up the --ARTIFACT (2/8)-- in the corner near the   |
| statue.                                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn left at the beginning then turn left when given the option again.      |
| Turn left again then quickly make another left and follow that trail to the |
| end to find this --ARTIFACT (3/8)-- near a plus shaped patch of grass.      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (4/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| It's more of your choice how you want to get this one since either side is  |
| long.  I'll give directions from the right side since it seems a bit        |
| shorter.                                                                    |
|                                                                             |
| Turn right at the beginning then follow the trail to a split and turn left. |
| Lara will emerge next to a tall statue.  Enter the path along the hedge on  |
| the back right across from Lara.  Take the second right followed by the     |
| first left. Lara will run down a set of zigzagging trails and emerge in an  |
| area with a large patch of grass.  Enter the trail ahead then follow it to  |
| the right.  Take the first left then move straight ahead to find this       |
| --ARTIFACT (4/8)--.                                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Turn right at the beginning then follow the trail to a split and turn left.
Lara will emerge next to a tall statue.  Enter the path along the hedge on the
back right across from Lara.  Take the second right followed by the first left.
Lara will run down a set of zigzagging trails and emerge in an area with a
large patch of grass.  Enter the trail ahead then follow it to the right.  Take
the first left then turn left again quickly.  Follow that path and take the
next left to emerge in the center.

Collect the ++GRAPPLE++ from the railing of the front right fountain.  Look
around the area and find the carvings for the bow and arrow around the middle
statues.  This is what the clues in the books were referring to.  The switch on
the ground in front of the statue cannot be used just yet.  Grapple the gold
*RING* on the gates of the entrance to this area and pull on the gate to pull
it open.

Exit the garden and return to the Living Room.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (5/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Since Lara now has the grapple, return to the Library (first door on the    |
| left [second floor]).  Grapple the *RING* hanging from the bottom of the    |
| chandelier and tug on it to make the bookcase to the right open up and      |
| reveal another secret alcove.  Collect the --ARTIFACT (5/8)-- from that     |
| alcove.  Lara can now exit this room from the door in the back.  Return to  |
| the Living Room and go back downstairs.                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Facing the fireplace, open the door on the left and follow the corridor behind
it to the fountain area then enter the gym.

GYM

Now that Lara has her grapple, she can perform most of the task in this area.

Walk up to the blue pad with the number "1" on it.  Jump and grab the *POLE* up
ahead and will swing around and position Lara in front of ledge.  Jump to grab
the *LEDGE* then hop across to the left *LEDGE*.  Leap to the *POLE* behind
Lara and it will turn just like the last.  Swing then jump to the *LEDGE* that
it will face.  Move to the right then hop over to the green *GRIPPERS* on the
right wall and climb them.  Leap to the *LEDGE* of the small walkway across
from the grippers then pull up collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  Press the
*BUTTON* on the back wall of the alcove to raise four metal columns near the
center of the gym.  Hang off the side of the walkway then drop to get back
down.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (6/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Approach the blue pad with the number "2" on it.  Leap to the *CREVICE* on  |
| the wall ahead then hop up to the next *CREVICE* on the wall.  Move to the  |
| left on top crevice.  Jump to the first *PERCHABLE COLUMN* across from      |
| crevice then jump to the next *PERCHABLE COLUN*.  Leap over to the *LEDGE*  |
| on the wall then shimmy over to the left crevice.  Hop up to the overhead   |
| *CREVICE* then move around the corner to the left.  On the far left, jump   |
| and grab onto the *LEDGE* of the alcove behind Lara.  Pull up and grab the  |
| --ARTIFACT (6/8)--.  Hang off the side of the alcove then drop to the       |
| *LEDGE* below and drop again to get down safely.                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Walk over to the blue mat with the number "3" on it.  Many areas can be reached
at key points from this mat.  Jump to the *CREVICE* on the wall ahead then hop
up to the next *CREVICE*

(a) Shimmy to the far left while on the crevice.  Jump and grapple the *RING*
on the wall behind Lara then wall run and leap to the *CREVICE* above the ramp
on the far wall.  Move to the left along the crevice then drop to the small
*LEDGE* below the left side of the crevice.  Jump into the alcove on the right.
Press the *BUTTON* on the wall to make a pole across from alcove turn to face
another way.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (7/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| (b) Shimmy to the far left while on the crevice.  Jump to the next          |
| *CREVICE* up above the current one.  Jump and grapple the *RING* on the     |
| wall.  When Lara runs to the far side, press toward the *RAMP* across from  |
| the wall and the jump button at the same time to make Lara jump to the      |
| *RAMP*.  Quickly jump to the next *RAMP* across from the first then quickly |
| leap to the *POLE* that was extended from the button that Lara pressed in   |
| step a.  The pole will turn so turn Lara around to face the alcove in the   |
| back of her.  Swing on the pole then leap to the alcove.  Collect the       |
| --ARTIFACT (7/8)-- from the alcove and slide down the ramp to get back to   |
| the floor safely.                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

(c) Shimmy to the right while on the crevice.  Jump to the next *CREVICE* above
then leap over to the *CREVICE* on the wall across from Lara.  Move to the
right so that Lara moves out to a *LEDGE*.  Jump to the *LEDGE* to the right of
the current one.  Drop to the lower *LEDGE* then shimmy all the way around the
right side of the *CREVICE* to the right.  Jump then grapple the *RING* on the
wall behind Lara.  Wall run then jump to the *CREVICE* above the ramp on the
other side.  Shimmy to the right around the corner and position Lara across
from the pole in the back of her.  Jump to grab the *POLE* and it will rotate
toward an alcove.  Swim then jump to the alcove and pick up the ++LARGE
MEDIPACK++.  Press the *BUTTON* on the wall to rotate another pole near the
number 3 pad.  To get back down safely, jump to the set of green *GRIPPERS* on
the wall to the side then climb to the bottom and drop.

(d) Shimmy to the right while on the crevice.  Jump to the next *CREVICE* above
then leap over to the *CREVICE* on the wall across from Lara.  Move to the
right so that Lara moves out to a *LEDGE*.  Jump to the *LEDGE* to the right of
the current one.  Leap to the *POLE* across from the ledge (behind Lara) then
swing and jump to the next *POLE* (this is the one that rotated earlier).
Swing then jump to the blue *COLUMN* hanging from the ceiling.  Hop over to the
next blue *COLUMN* then leap to the tall *PERCHABLE COLUMN* to the side.  Jump
to the next *PERCHABLE COLUMN* then leap to the metal walkway suspended above
the middle of the gym.  Grab the --WRENCH-- from the other end of the walkway.
To get back down safely spot the green *GRIPPERS* on the wall below the end
where Lara collected the wrench then climb down and drop.

Return to the Living Room.

(It's better if the water is turned on before entering the pool room, so the
pool will be full.)

BACK IN THE MAZE GARDEN

Open the door up the stairs across from the fireplace.  Follow the corridor on
the outside of the Garden Maze until Lara reaches the far end.  Use the Wrench
on the yellow *VALVE* then grab the *WRENCH* and pull it to turn the water back
on throughout the manor.  Walk over to the nearby fountain and use the Empty
Bucket to get a --BUCKET OF WATER--.  Return to the Living Room once again.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

If the crate was positioned on the *PRESSURE PLATE* in the Living Room from
earlier then the panel in the back of the fireplace is already open.  Stand in
front of the fireplace and use the Bucket of Water to put out the fire.  Grab
the --DECORATIVE ARROW-- from the back of the fireplace.

Open the door to the right of the fireplace to reach the Pool Room.  Follow the
corridor and open the next door.

POOL ROOM

Walk through the doorway ahead to enter the Pool Room.  It is under
construction still.  Grab the red *CONTAINER* full of planks and poles and
position it next to the right set of overhead walkways - push it up until the
board on the floor stops it.  Shoot the gold *PIECE* on the chain below the
piece of wood in the back to make the wood piece tilt.

Walk over to the stack of crates in the far right corner and climb on top of
the them.  Leap to the yellow *POLE* next to the tall walkway to the side then
jump and grab the circular *LEDGE* then extends across the second floor
balcony.  Move to the right across the ledge.  On the far right, jump to the
space in between the boards behind Lara, forming a *CREVICE*, then shimmy
across to the middle of it.  Jump to the wooden walkway across from Lara then
pull up.  Look to the left to spot a gold piece hanging from the spear of the
Athena statue.  Jump to *POLE* portion at the bottom of the object and Lara's
weight will eventually make the arms of the statue move downward causing the
spear to form a pole for Lara to swing across.

FINDING THE FIRST ROPE

Return to the *CREVICE* in the boards then shimmy around to the far right side
of that crevice.  Jump to grab the *POLE* portion of the spear then leap across
to the walkway up ahead.  Grab the handle of the small red *CONTAINER* full of
pipes and drag it over to the circular *PRESSURE PLATE* on the right side of
the single statue in the middle.  Notice the X marking on the ground in front
of the statue.  Grab ahold of the circular railing on the side of the statue
and pull it toward the middle X.  Rotate the red *CONTAINER* so that the pole
hits the spear of the statue.  This will make the panel behind the statue
rotate to reveal a hidden button.  Shoot the *BUTTON* with Lara's handguns to
open one of the gates in the pool.

Hop over the debris of the fallen statue and collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++
from the other end of the walkway.  Shoot *ROPE 1* on the chain to the side to
loosen the rope holding up the statue in the middle of the pool.  Return to the
other side of the walkway and jump back to the *POLE* followed by the
*CREVICE*.  Shimmy to the middle of the crevice then leap over to the high
wooden walkway that Lara was on before.  Jump to the pole, forming a *PERCHABLE
COLUMN*, extending out of the container that Lara positioned below then leap
over to the other side of the walkway.

FINDING THE SECOND ROPE

Move to the far end of the walkway then jump and grapple the *RING* on the wall
above and wall run then jump to the walkway on the other side.  Push the
*CRATE* on the right down to the floor below - this allows Lara to get back up
here quicker if she falls.  Run over to the walkway on the other side.  Stand
in front of the statue of Atlas then grapple the *RING* on the bottom plate of
the statue then tug on it to make Atlas drop the metal *SPHERE* in his hands.
Move the *SPHERE* over the circular *PRESSURE PLATE* in front of the statue to
open up the second gate in the pool.  Hop over the blocks on the right side and
collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ then shoot *ROPE 2* tied to the chain.

FINDING THE THIRD ROPE

Walk back over to the portion of the wooden walkway where Lara pushed off the
crate just a few minutes ago and jump to the loose plank near that side.  The
plank will tilt, so stay at the first end until it starts to move upward then
quickly run to the opposite end and jump to grab the *LEDGE* at the top of the
wooden planks up along the metal structure ahead.  Move to the right then jump
to grab the next *LEDGE* on the planks across from the far right side - Lara
will turn in the air to grab them. Leap over to the walkway across from the set
of planks and shoot *ROPE 3*.  The statue will fall and shatter into the pool
below.

Fall into the pool below and grab the --DECORATIVE BOW-- from the remains of
the statue.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (8/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Swim into the hole on the side of the pool and follow the tunnel then grab  |
| the --ARTIFACT (8/8)-- from near the end.  If the gates are still sealed    |
| off then one of the objects above was not moved over one of the circular    |
| pressure plates up above.  Pull the *LEVER* on the right wall to open the   |
| gate that leads to the pool in the gym.  The lever cannot be pulled if the  |
| water is not on.  Surface and return to the Living Room.                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

RERETURNING TO THE GARDEN MAZE

Once again, go back to the Garden Maze.  Turn left on the outside corridor to
the to head back into the maze.  Walk through both sets of gates then place the
Decorative Bow on the left hand of the statue and the Decorative Arrow on the
right hand of the statue.  Walk back to the front of the statue and grapple the
*RING* on the panel while facing the statue.  Pull the panel covering off with
the grapple then place the Sculpture Gear inside the set of gears.  Pull the
*LEVER* in front of the statue and watch as the statue shoots the other statue.
The wounded statue will drop an item.  Run over to the statue and grab the
--MUSIC BOX CYLINDER--.

Return to the Living Room.  Run put the stairs and open the second door to the
right.  Follow the hall to the very end.

MUSIC ROOM

Place the Music Box Cylinder on the left panel of the door at the end of hall
to unlock the door.  Open the door to finish all of Croft Manor - the results
will display a few seconds after Lara enters.

Lara can interact with all the musical instruments in the Music Room.  She can
also play any unlocked track from the game over on the record player to the
right.

Total Game Completion = 100% (if all other levels are finished)

-- Version History

Version 1.0 - (July 2, 2007) - Walkthrough is complete!  I decided to spend all
of yesterday on Croft Manor even though I was thinking about adding it later
next week.  The guide needs some proofreading which I'll get to at a later
date.

Version 1.0 - (July 3, 2007) - Added my recently started blog address since I
forgot to put it in here in the first version.  Check the "About Me" section.
I'll be adding some more room/area names on the next update so readers won't
have to read through so many paragraphs in the walkthrough section.

Version 1.1 - (August 13, 2007) - Added a note about a bug in the St. Francis
Folly area - the Damocles Room.  Also added a note about how to turn the
commentaries on and some more info about the cheats in the reward section.

Version 1.2 - (October 3, 2007) - Added some information on the quick turn
while swinging on poles.  Information was added at the top portion under
"Poles" and on the Fourth Floor of The Great Pyramid stage.

Version 1.2 - (November 26, 2007) - Corrected a few minor typos.  I might add
some more info to this guide before the end of the year since more version of
TR:A have been released - I'm noticing that it really needs a weapons section
with locations for each, not to mention a good proofreading.

Version 1.3 - (December 29, 2007) - The Xbox 360 achievements for the game were
added at the bottom of the Rewards section and I added an extra note under the
Centaur battle since I receive quite a few emails about grappling their
shields.

Version 1.3 - (January 7, 2008) - Changed a bit of wording here and there
thanks to some feedback from a reader - mainly dealing with the adrenaline
dodge.  Just a little note, if anyone ever finds the wording in a particular
area a little off then please email me and point out the particular area of the
walkthrough where it is located.

-- Contact Info

I can be reached at my email address, which is > berserker_kev @ yahoo.com <,
so please contact me if you have any questions, comments, etc.  I don't mind
receiving emails at all.  All I ask is for you to try to make the email decent.
I realize that some people do not speak perfect English or cannot type that
well, so that doesn't really matter to me, but all that I ask is that you try
to make it readable.  If you found this walkthrough helpful, an email would be
most appreciated.

I would prefer you not to add me to your messenger, but if you do, at least
tell me a bit about yourself and why, or if I know you, tell me who you are.
One of my pet peeves is when people just add me to their messenger without
saying anything.  I usually just deny their request.

-- About Me

Well, my name is Kevin.  I'm 27 years old (as of March 2007) and reside in the
US (Mississippi).  I've been an avid player of video games ever since I first
got an Atari 2600 back when I was 6 years old.  I've tried to escape into many
other hobbies but always wind up back to square one with video games.  My
favorite gaming series is Resident Evil by far, then second would be
Castlevania.  Playing just about any survival horror is a major high point in
my gaming experience.

A few of my other interests include horror movies, anime, and I'm a complete
message board junkie.  You can find me at Artic Nightfall (Berserker) or the
Resident Evil or Castlevania IGN message boards (berserker_kev) from time to
time.  I'm also a big fan of viewing artwork, though I can't draw myself.  Even
though I can't draw, I try to be a creative person through writing, and
hopefully that reflects in my guides.  My dream is to be a professional
walkthrough writer, but until then I will continue to publish guides for free
on GameFAQs and the various other gaming sites.

For any other info about me, please see my FAQ Writer of the Month interview at
IGN:

thoughts about video games.  Feel free to post up some comments on the blog.  I
don't bite... well not that much... and not too viciously...
