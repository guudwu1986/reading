FINDING THE THIRD ROPE

Walk back over to the portion of the wooden walkway where Lara pushed off the
crate just a few minutes ago and jump to the loose plank near that side.  The
plank will tilt, so stay at the first end until it starts to move upward then
quickly run to the opposite end and jump to grab the *LEDGE* at the top of the
wooden planks up along the metal structure ahead.  Move to the right then jump
to grab the next *LEDGE* on the planks across from the far right side - Lara
will turn in the air to grab them. Leap over to the walkway across from the set
of planks and shoot *ROPE 3*.  The statue will fall and shatter into the pool
below.

Fall into the pool below and grab the --DECORATIVE BOW-- from the remains of
the statue.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (8/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Swim into the hole on the side of the pool and follow the tunnel then grab  |
| the --ARTIFACT (8/8)-- from near the end.  If the gates are still sealed    |
| off then one of the objects above was not moved over one of the circular    |
| pressure plates up above.  Pull the *LEVER* on the right wall to open the   |
| gate that leads to the pool in the gym.  The lever cannot be pulled if the  |
| water is not on.  Surface and return to the Living Room.                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

RERETURNING TO THE GARDEN MAZE

Once again, go back to the Garden Maze.  Turn left on the outside corridor to
the to head back into the maze.  Walk through both sets of gates then place the
Decorative Bow on the left hand of the statue and the Decorative Arrow on the
right hand of the statue.  Walk back to the front of the statue and grapple the
*RING* on the panel while facing the statue.  Pull the panel covering off with
the grapple then place the Sculpture Gear inside the set of gears.  Pull the
*LEVER* in front of the statue and watch as the statue shoots the other statue.
The wounded statue will drop an item.  Run over to the statue and grab the
--MUSIC BOX CYLINDER--.

Return to the Living Room.  Run put the stairs and open the second door to the
right.  Follow the hall to the very end.

MUSIC ROOM

Place the Music Box Cylinder on the left panel of the door at the end of hall
to unlock the door.  Open the door to finish all of Croft Manor - the results
will display a few seconds after Lara enters.

Lara can interact with all the musical instruments in the Music Room.  She can
also play any unlocked track from the game over on the record player to the
right.

Total Game Completion = 100% (if all other levels are finished)

-- Version History

Version 1.0 - (July 2, 2007) - Walkthrough is complete!  I decided to spend all
of yesterday on Croft Manor even though I was thinking about adding it later
next week.  The guide needs some proofreading which I'll get to at a later
date.

Version 1.0 - (July 3, 2007) - Added my recently started blog address since I
forgot to put it in here in the first version.  Check the "About Me" section.
I'll be adding some more room/area names on the next update so readers won't
have to read through so many paragraphs in the walkthrough section.

Version 1.1 - (August 13, 2007) - Added a note about a bug in the St. Francis
Folly area - the Damocles Room.  Also added a note about how to turn the
commentaries on and some more info about the cheats in the reward section.

Version 1.2 - (October 3, 2007) - Added some information on the quick turn
while swinging on poles.  Information was added at the top portion under
"Poles" and on the Fourth Floor of The Great Pyramid stage.

Version 1.2 - (November 26, 2007) - Corrected a few minor typos.  I might add
some more info to this guide before the end of the year since more version of
TR:A have been released - I'm noticing that it really needs a weapons section
with locations for each, not to mention a good proofreading.

Version 1.3 - (December 29, 2007) - The Xbox 360 achievements for the game were
added at the bottom of the Rewards section and I added an extra note under the
Centaur battle since I receive quite a few emails about grappling their
shields.

Version 1.3 - (January 7, 2008) - Changed a bit of wording here and there
thanks to some feedback from a reader - mainly dealing with the adrenaline
dodge.  Just a little note, if anyone ever finds the wording in a particular
area a little off then please email me and point out the particular area of the
walkthrough where it is located.

-- Contact Info

I can be reached at my email address, which is > berserker_kev @ yahoo.com <,
so please contact me if you have any questions, comments, etc.  I don't mind
receiving emails at all.  All I ask is for you to try to make the email decent.
I realize that some people do not speak perfect English or cannot type that
well, so that doesn't really matter to me, but all that I ask is that you try
to make it readable.  If you found this walkthrough helpful, an email would be
most appreciated.

I would prefer you not to add me to your messenger, but if you do, at least
tell me a bit about yourself and why, or if I know you, tell me who you are.
One of my pet peeves is when people just add me to their messenger without
saying anything.  I usually just deny their request.

-- About Me

Well, my name is Kevin.  I'm 27 years old (as of March 2007) and reside in the
US (Mississippi).  I've been an avid player of video games ever since I first
got an Atari 2600 back when I was 6 years old.  I've tried to escape into many
other hobbies but always wind up back to square one with video games.  My
favorite gaming series is Resident Evil by far, then second would be
Castlevania.  Playing just about any survival horror is a major high point in
my gaming experience.

A few of my other interests include horror movies, anime, and I'm a complete
message board junkie.  You can find me at Artic Nightfall (Berserker) or the
Resident Evil or Castlevania IGN message boards (berserker_kev) from time to
time.  I'm also a big fan of viewing artwork, though I can't draw myself.  Even
though I can't draw, I try to be a creative person through writing, and
hopefully that reflects in my guides.  My dream is to be a professional
walkthrough writer, but until then I will continue to publish guides for free
on GameFAQs and the various other gaming sites.

For any other info about me, please see my FAQ Writer of the Month interview at
IGN:

thoughts about video games.  Feel free to post up some comments on the blog.  I
don't bite... well not that much... and not too viciously...
