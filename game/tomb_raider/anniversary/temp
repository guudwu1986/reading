Journey back to 1996 in the city of Calcutta, India where Lara first learns
about the location of the Scion of Atlantis that her and her father spent years
searching for.  Lara is hired by Natla - the head of Natla Industries - to find
and retrieve the pieces of the Scion.  Lara hurries to Peru to find the first
piece of the Scion as well as start the retelling of one of her greatest
adventures.

I have been a Tomb Raider fan ever since I played the first Tomb Raider back in
1996.  After the first most excellent game I moved on to Tomb Raider II and
felt somewhat amused.  Since Tomb Raider III, I had just about given up on the
Tomb Raider series because of the gameplay and difficulty.  I enjoyed the main
character and the stories but couldn't deal with the gameplay even though I
tried to reemerge myself with Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation.  When Tomb
Raider Chronicles and Angel of Darkness came along, I had given up by that time
and still haven't tried those games to this day.

Tomb Raider: Legend was an excellent reawakening of the series in my eyes - so
much so, that I felt the need to write a guide for it.  This guide for Tomb
Raider: Anniversary continues my enjoyment for the new Tomb Raider installments
brought to us by developer Crystal Dynamics!

===========
 Obstacles
===========

--> Ledge (or Crevice)

- Lara can grab onto the side of a ledge or crevice by jumping or falling
toward either obstacle while holding R2 (if safety grab is disabled).

- Lara can shimmy along the ledge or crevice by moving the left analog in the
direction that you want her to move.  Tap /\ while moving to have Lara move
quicker.

- Press the O button to let go of a ledge or crevice

- Hold down on the left analog then press X to jump away, hold in the direction
of the end of the ledge or crevice then press X to have Lara jump to the side;
press X without tapping a direction to make Lara jump straight up in order to
reach a higher obstacle.

--> Pole

- Lara can grab onto a pole by jumping or falling toward it while holding R2
(if safety grab is disabled).

- Use the left analog while hanging to position her along the side of the pole.

- Push in the direction that Lara is facing to have her swing on the pole; tap
the opposite direction to have Lara turn around.

- Press the X button to jump while swinging or press the O button in order to
drop from the pole.

- Hold the opposite direction while swinging to have Lara perform a quick turn
on the pole.  She will turn in midair while swinging.

--> Rope

- Jump toward a rope and Lara will grab onto the rope while in midair.

- Hold the /\ button and move the analog either up or down to make Lara climb
or descend the rope respectively; Move the analog to the left or right to
position the way that Lara is facing.

- Press up and down to make Lara swing on the rope then press the X button once
she has built up enough momentum to jump to her destination.

--> Ring

-- Ceiling Rings

Press the [] button while Lara is jumping below a ceiling ring to have her
grapple to it with her grapple.  Ceiling rings will allow Lara to swing from
them much like a rope.

-- Wall Rings

Press the [] button while Lara is jumping below a wall ring to have her grapple
to it with her grapple.  She will stretch out her legs and start to run back
and forth along the wall.

- Press either up or down on the left analog to have Lara continue to run back
and forth on the wall.  Once Lara swings in the direction of her destination
press the X button to have her jump.  Sometimes you must hold the direction of
destination AND tap the X button in order to make her jump in that direction.

- Press and hold in the opposite direction Lara is running to have her stop and
stay suspended with her feet on the wall.  Hold the /\ button and move the left
analog up or down to have her climb or lower herself while on the grapple.  Tap
the X button to make Lara jump away from the wall.

--> Column

- Jump toward a slender column and Lara will grab onto the column and wrap her
arms and legs around it.

- Move the left analog up or down to make Lara climb or descend the column.

- Press the X button along with the direction of her destination in to
automatically jump in that direction.  Press the X button without a direction
to make Lara jump away from the column (whichever way is to her back).

--> Perchable Column

- Jump toward a slender column with a flat top to make Lara land on top of the
column and stay perched on the column as long as she keeps her balance.  Press
the /\ button when Lara starts to lose her balance.

- Press in the direction of her destination along with the X button to have
Lara jump in that direction from her perched position.

==============
 Lara's Moves
==============

--> Adrenaline Dodge

While firing at a locked-on target (hold L1 to lock on), if the enemy becomes
enraged (flash followed by a sudden dash), wait until the screen blurs while
the enemy approaches Lara then press any direction + the dodge button (O) in
order to make Lara dodge in the desired direction in slow motion.  Keep the
auto-targeting activated while dodging and two crosshairs will form over the
target while Lara aims in mid-air.  The crosshairs will eventually form one
crosshair then turn red.  Once the crosshair is red, press R1 to fire and score
a one-hit kill on all normal enemies.  The adrenaline dodge is used quite often
to stun bosses so you must become familiar with using this!

--> Wall Run

Jump and grapple to any gold rings mounted along the side of a wall and Lara
will begin a wall run.  Press to the left and right on the left analog to make
Lara run then press X to jump.  Stop pressing a direction or quickly pull in
the opposite direction to have her stop.  Hold /\ then press up or down to have
Lara climb up or down the grapple.  Press X while standing still on a wall to
have Lara jump backward off of the wall.

** When leaping to an area that is across from the wall that Lara is wall
running on, press toward the platform (or area) AND press the jump button as
soon as Lara is about to turn on the wall. <  This will make Lara turn toward
the platform then kick off the wall with her legs and jump toward the area
across from her.  The timing must be fairly precise and the platform must be
across from Lara, so line her up with it if she isn't already across from it
during some portion of the wall run.

--> Somersault

Press X twice in succession (once for a jump then again) to make Lara perform a
somersault jump.

--> Crouching/Dodging

Press and hold the O button to make Lara crouch in order to move under overhead
obstacles.  Press the O button while holding a direction to have Lara quickly
dodge in that direction.  Press O about a second after rolling to make Lara
spring upward feet first

--> Flips and Spinning Jump

Tap the O button while holding forward on the left analog to make Lara perform
a series of forward flips followed by a spinning somersault.  Tap the X button
during the flips to make Lara perform some different flips and an even higher
ending jump.

--> Walking

Press and hold the R2 button while moving to make Lara walk.  This is helpful
in highly dangerous areas and helps with precision when moving.

--> Dive

Quickly tap X followed by O to make Lara perform a dive.  This move is very
helpful when jumping into water since Lara will remain submerged a bit in the
pool in stead of floating to the top.

--> Special Pull up

Press and hold X while pulling up to make Lara swing her legs onto the platform
in order to pull her body up onto the ledge.

This walkthrough section offers a complete step-by-step walkthrough of the main
of Tomb Raider: Anniversary.  It comes complete with explanations on how to
obtain all hidden artifacts and relics.  Artifacts and Relics sections are
boxed off in the sections of the game where each of them is available.  The
rest of the walkthrough around those extra sections continues as if the player
was still continuing with the main quest (for the most part) - sometimes the
extra items offer a shortcut along with the collecting.

Please note that many of the "right" and "left" directions refer to Lara's
right or left.  Everything in the guide is explained through Lara's point of
view or no point of view at all to avoid constant "you's" throughout the guide.

 \-----------------/

CLIMB UP THE MOUNTAIN

Walk forward and find the *LEDGE* behind the column shaped rock of the broken
bridge.  Walk up onto the slightly raised rock then jump to the ledge.  Shimmy
to the right (press /\ to move faster) then perform a lateral jump by holding
to the right and jumping to catch onto the next *LEDGE*.  Line Lara up with the
snowy platform once she moves around the corner then hold down and jump to grab
onto the side then have Lara pull herself up.

Jump to the next rock platform off to the side then move up the raised portion
and jump to grab the first *LEDGE* in front of Lara.  Jump again while Lara is
hanging to grab another *LEDGE* then pull up.  Look to the left and Lara will
spot a *RING* overhead.  Jump and use the Grapple button ([]) to grapple to the
ring then swing across - press X to jump from the grapple.  The camera will
show a view of the gate up ahead as a checkpoint activates.

Please note that you must manually save your game in order to start from each
checkpoint - the game does not autosave except for between stages.

-- Checkpoint

OPENING THE GATE

If Lara speaks with the guide then he will eventually mention that he doesn't
know how to get the gate open.

Find the slanted rock on the left side of the mountain wall then run up it and
jump to the rock platform to the left of the gate.  Look to the right after
Lara pulls herself up and she will spot a *RING* in front of the gate.  Jump
and grapple to the ring then swing and jump over to the rock platform on the
other side.

Grab onto the first *LEDGE* to the right of the gate then shimmy to the left
and jump to grab the overhead *LEDGE*.  Hold to the left then jump and grab the
*LEDGE* of the platform above the gate.  Once Lara pulls herself up, press the
*BUTTON* at the top to open the gate below and trigger a cutscene.

-- Checkpoint

EXPLORING THE TUNNEL

Run deeper into the tunnel ahead.  Lara will eventually run over a *PRESSURE
SWITCH* that will trigger some arrow traps up ahead - there can be turned off
(next paragraph).  Carefully run past the arrows when a break is found in each
set.  Use Lara's roll (O) to move through each set quicker.

The traps can be turned off by pulling two levers.  Move just a bit past the
pressure switch (before the first trap) then look back.  Jump and grab the
first *LEDGE* to the right while looking back then grab the next *LEDGE*
overhead.  Traverse to the left and grab the next overhead *LEDGE* then jump
and grab the large ++LEVER 1++ up above.  When the lever in pulled all the way
down, jump to wall behind Lara to grab a hidden *LEDGE* on the wall behind her.
Move to the left then fall and have Lara grab onto the second ++LEVER 2++ to
turn off the arrow traps.

-- Checkpoint

WOODEN PLATFORM AREA

Lara will notice a ledge on the left wall up above but it is too far off for
her to reach.

Move around the right corner and run up the staircase on the right side.  Hop
across to the other side of the bridge off to the left then jump to the wooden
platform at the end of the left side of the rock platform.  Lara will
automatically notice the left ledge off to the side but there is a hidden ledge
on the left once she turns around to stare at the area where she just came
from.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/3)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn around to notice a small *LEDGE* on the left side.  Jump to the ledge  |
| then pull up to the small rock platform.  Jump to the next rock platform    |
| then follow it as it curves to the right.  Jump and grab the *LEDGE* of the |
| next platform then pull up.  Walk under the overhead rock structure and     |
| find the next platform to Lara's right on the other side.  The artifact     |
| will be in Lara's view by the time she reaches this platform.  Move toward  |
| the side with the artifact and slide down the ramp then quickly jump and    |
| grab the *LEDGE* of the side with the artifact then have Lara pull herself  |
| up so she can collect the --ARTIFACT (1/3)--.                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Jump and grab the *LEDGE* to the right and shimmy to the left then drop at the
to the second floor tunnel if Lara got the artifact.  If not, then jump to the
*LEDGE* on the left and shimmy to the left and have Lara pull herself up to the
second floor tunnel.

-- Checkpoint

THE BAT TUNNEL

Have Lara draw her handguns (hold L1) and shoot (R1) the three bats that attack
from the tunnel ahead.  Reload the handguns afterwards (/\ while holding L1).
Walk over to the alcove on the left side before entering the tunnel where the
bats attacked from.

Stand on the raised portion of rock in front of the concrete wall on the right
side of the alcove then jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the concrete wall.  Have
Lara pull herself up then grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ at the top.  Continue
into the tunnel where the bats came from.  Lara will need to draw her handguns
once again since another group of three bats will attack in the next area.

-- Checkpoint

A HIDDEN CAVERN

Don't slide down the ramp!

- To get back up (just in case)

Did Lara accidentally slide down and get attacked by the two bats at the
bottom?  Well then, look to Lara's left and find the visible ledge on the small
rock platform against the rock wall.  Jump and grab the *LEDGE* then have Lara
pull herself up to the small platform.  Jump and grab the next *LEDGE* then the
next *LEDGE*.  Move to the left side of the second ledge then have Lara jump to
the *LEDGE* behind her.  Traverse to the left then grab the next overhead
*LEDGE* and move to the left some more until Lara reaches the end.  Jump to her
left and grab the *LEDGE* on the top floor and move to the left then drop back
to the top.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/3)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| If Lara looks up before sliding down the ramp, she will notice a *RING* on  |
| the ceiling in front of the ramp.  Jump while sliding down the very top of  |
| the ramp then grapple the ring in midjump and swing across to the *LEDGE*   |
| on the far mossy wall - you'll need to stop on the grapple and move up a    |
| bit (hold /\ and press up) then continue swinging.                          |
|                                                                             |
| Traverse to the left then jump and grab the overhead *LEDGE*.  Jump and     |
| grab the next *LEDGE* behind Lara then move to the right and drop (O) then  |
| grab onto the *LEDGE* below.  Climb to the right then jump and grab onto    |
| the *LEDGE* of the rock platform across from Lara.  Once Lara pulls herself |
| up grab the --ARTIFACT (2/3)--.  Walk off the side of the platform then     |
| grab the ledge on the side.  Fall to the *LEDGE* on the left side then fall |
| down below to avoid taking damage.                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Find the lower tunnel leading to a door and drop to it from either side.  While
moving down the steps a switch will come into view on the right wall.  Pull the
*SWITCH* (/\) to open the door.  Continue past the door, down the steps, and
through the next doorway.

-- Checkpoint

MOVING ACROSS THE FIRST BRIDGE

Don't fall below the bridge or Lara will get ambushed!  Instead, move along the
right side of the current floor and two wolves will pop out of a hidden alcove
below.  Lara can now draw her handguns and shoot mercilessly at the beast from
above.  Fall down into the pit below the bridge once the wolves have been
killed and find the other alcove against the back wall to discover a ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ inside.  While leaving the alcove Lara will notice the final
artifact on a high platform up above, but this cannot be collected in this
area.

Have Lara make her way up to the side of the first bridge.  While trying to
cross the bridge, it will suddenly break once Lara reaches the middle portion.
Walk toward the side with the two hanging pieces of bridge and jump to grab the
*LEDGES* in between each piece then have Lara pull herself up to the other
side.

-- Checkpoint

MOVING ACROSS THE SECOND BRIDGE

Find the two *LEDGES* on the right wall that will allow Lara to jump up to the
next floor.  Before going across the next bridge however, turn around to spot
some ledges along the two narrow columns in the back of Lara.

Jump diagonally to the first *LEDGE* closest to Lara then move to the right and
jump to grab the higher *LEDGE*.  Jump to the lower *LEDGE* on the next column
behind Lara. Move to the right then jump and grab the *LEDGE* of the hidden
alcove next to the column and have Lara pull herself up in order to collect
another ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  Drop from the alcove and get back to the second
bridge.

Move across the second bridge and jump to the left walkway on the other side.
Lara will eventually come to a pit with a rope dangling overhead.

-- Checkpoint

BEAR TRAP

If Lara should fall into the pit then a bear will attack.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/3)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Fall into the pit and fight off the bear that appears by jumping (X) over   |
| or dodging (O) his attacks while shooting.  Lara can also fall down the     |
| *LEDGES* on the right side of the pit and lure the bear out then jump back  |
| to the top and shoot him from above.  Run down the alcove that bear the     |
| lunged from and pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall to open the door.  Fall |
| down to the tunnel below and look to the right to see the --ARTIFACT        |
| (3/3)-- from earlier.  Lara will have to drop to the area below since the   |
| door behind her will close.  This is the pit below the bridges where the    |
| wolves attacked.  Backtrack to the pit with the rope overhead.              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump to the *ROPE* then turn to face the alcove on the left side.  Build up
enough momentum then swing to the alcove and pick up the --LARGE MEDIPACK--
inside.  Lara will need to jump back to the right side of the pit to leave the
alcove safely.  Use the rope again to swing across to the other side of the
pit.  Check behind the second pillar on the left side to find another --LARGE
MEDIPACK--.  Move down the ramp in the middle and walk up the steps to continue
through the next doorway ahead.

Lara will come upon an area with greenery along the walls as she emerges from
the doorway.  Jump to the *POLE* on the left wall then swing and jump to the
broken stairway on the other side of the pit.  Use the platform and the *LEDGE*
of the higher floor to climb up to the floor above.  Run up the steps and make
a left at the corner.  Enter the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

OPENING THE FINAL DOOR

Run past each set of arrows as a break is found in the shooting (crouch and
move underneath the second trap) and run to the large door at the end of the
corridor.  As Lara steps on the *PRESSURE SWITCH* in front of the large door, a
bar will seal the door further and the camera will show two locks on the top of
the door along with a high platform on the left side.  As the tutorial
mentions, access the Journal by pressing Select then press down and select the
journal to hear thoughts from Lara on the current situation - don't expect much
besides the obvious.

Jump up the set of three *LEDGES* on the left wall and pull Lara up to the left
high platform.  A howl will give way to a wolf attack as a wolf darts through
the left doorway.  As Lara looks on the wall to the right side, two ledges will
be visible.  Jump to the first *LEDGE* then move across and jump to the next
*LEDGE*.  Move to the right on the high ledge then jump to the right to grab
the *LEDGE* on ++GATE LOCK 1++.  This will pull the bar out of the top of the
gate in the middle, but it is timed, and will slowly fall back into place in
about a minute.

Rush through the doorway where the wolf came from and find the set of three
*POLES* on the far left wall (move past all the pillars along the side).  Jump
across all the poles then get ready to shoot two wolves on the other side as
they run through the doorway.  Through the doorway, Lara will come upon a piece
of concrete debris with a *LEDGE* above it on the right wall.  Grab onto the
ledge then jump to the higher *LEDGE* up above.  Jump to the *POLE* behind Lara
and it will rotate to the area in front of the next gate lock.  Swing and grab
the *LEDGE* on ++GATE LOCK 2++ to open the middle gate.  Fall down the *LEDGES*
along the side that Lara is currently on to get back down to the pressure
switch then step on the *PRESSURE SWITCH* once again to open the gate.

-- Checkpoint

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                RELIC (1/1)                                  |
|=============================================================================|
| (Lara must open the door to get this relic since a pole will extend above   |
| the door that will allow her to reach the relic.)                           |
|                                                                             |
| Don't go through the gate just yet.  Get back on the high platform with the |
| second gate lock - you'll have to start from the left side and work back    |
| across to the other side like before.  Jump up the two ledges on the right  |
| wall like before but position Lara on the far left side of the top ledge.   |
| Jump to the *POLE* then quickly jump during Lara's first swing so that she  |
| jumps at an angle toward the wall on the right side up ahead as the pole    |
| turns - she will grab onto the *LEDGE* on the right wall.                   |
|                                                                             |
| Move to the left on the ledge and jump to the *POLE* above the doorway to   |
| the left.  Climb to the middle of the pole then swing and jump to the small |
| *LEDGE* above the left side of the door.  Jump to the higher *LEDGE* up     |
| above then leap toward the high *POLE* above the doorway.  Swing then jump  |
| toward the *LEDGE* then jump up to the higher *LEDGE* and pull Lara up to   |
| the platform with the KILLER WHALE BOTTLE RELIC (1/1).  Fall off the wide   |
| end of the platform with the relic and grab the side *LEDGE* then fall and  |
| grab onto the *LEDGE* below Lara in order to get back down easily.          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Fall back down the ledges on the right wall like before then go through the
doorway and up the stairs to end the level.

At the top of the stairs, a bear will attack Lara so have the guns ready.  The
tutorial for the Adrenaline Dodge will commence once the beast is fired upon.
Lock onto an enemy and wait for the enemy to become enraged and run at Lara.
The screen will blur at this time and that is when Lara can perform a slow
motion dodge by pressing the O button along with a direction and to dodge to
the side as the enemy attacks.  Lara will keep her guns focused on the enemy
during a successful dodge and a big targeting marker will appear on the enemy -
press the R1 button to shoot the enemy at this time and Lara will shoot the
enemy directly in the head and kill the enemy instantly, no matter what gun she
has equipped.

Continue through the corridor ahead then jump to the first *COLUMN* sticking
out of the pit.  Slide down the column and check behind the concrete debris
below the side that Lara jumped from to find a ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  Walk over
to the other column on the other side of the pit and find the *LEDGE* in front
of it and to the right.  Jump to the ledge then jump to the next *LEDGE* past
the greenery on the left then jump and grab onto the higher *LEDGE*.  Hop over
to the *COLUMN* and climb to the top then leap to the other side of the
walkway.  Walk through the doorway.

-- Checkpoint

CITY OF VILCABAMABA

Two wolves will attack Lara at the bottom of the stairs down the corridor
ahead.

-- Checkpoint

A bear will run out from the side of a small building as Lara enters the
village.  The wooden door ahead requires a key to open it.

Jump into the water at the bottom of the small waterfall and swim to the very
bottom (O) then grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ in the corner.  Be sure to surface
again (X) to get a full air gauge.  Dive back down just a bit and swim through
the opening in the wall.  Tap the /\ button to swim faster.  Swim toward the
*LEVER* on the dead end wall and pull it to open the trapdoor up above.  Swim
to the top and move to one of the sides to have Lara pull herself up.

-- Checkpoint

Pull the *SWITCH* to open the wooden door to the side.  This will allow Lara
back out into the village area.

-- Checkpoint

Run up the steps inside of the building then jump and grab the *LEDGE* of the
window on the building across from the current one and have Lara pull herself
up inside the next building.

When Lara steps on the wooden plank leading into the building it will crumble.
Run across the wooden plank quickly and jump toward the *LEDGE* of the alcove
across from the plank to grab a ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  If Lara happens to miss
the jump then pull the *METAL CAGE* out from the doorway to the side and push
it near the alcove then jump to it.  Aim at the *LOCK* on the set of double
doors and shoot it to open the doors.

Push the metal cage through the doorway and into the area ahead.  Stay along
the right wall then get up on the cage as Lara nears the two steps in the back
and jump on top then grab the *LEDGE* of the floor above and have Lara pull
herself up.  Walk across the wooden bridge and collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++
and ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Fall back down to the area with the cage and find the
other set of ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ underneath the wooden bridge.  Move around the
left corner past the shotgun ammo pickup to find the --VILLAGE KEY--.

| Grab the *CAGE* once again and push it back through the doorway.  Push it   |
| outside of the building (through the double doors) and past the first       |
| building off to the right.  Find the column in between the buildings and    |
| push it up to the base of the column.  Get on the cage then jump on top of  |
| the base of the column (Lara can just barely stand on it) then climb the    |
| *COLUMN*.  Climb all the way to the top then leap over to the *LEDGE* on    |
| the mountain wall beside the column.  Move over to the left quickly and     |
| have Lara pull herself up onto the platform since two bats will attack.     |
| Swing on the *POLE* then jump to the *LEDGE* of the high platform on the    |

| to the left then jump and swing on the next two *POLES*.  Lara will land on |
| a high platform with the --ARTIFACT (1/1)--.  Some bats will attack as she  |
| lands.  To get back down, jump on the roof of the building below the        |
| platform in order to slide down the roof and safely land on the floor       |
| below.                                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Use the Village Key on the wooden doorway that is closed to gain access to the
area ahead - select if from the inventory to use it.

-- Checkpoint

PAST THE VILLAGE

A familiar howl will sound from behind the door.  Two wolves will attack as
Lara walks toward the pillar in the middle of the room.  A third wolf will run
at Lara as she moves through the doorway ahead.  Move up the stairs and Lara
will have a choice of two doors.  Both of the rooms must explored in order to
open the middle doorway.

-- Checkpoint

RIGHT DOORWAY

-- Checkpoint

Dive into the pool through the next doorway and pick up the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++
from the middle.  Surface to the top and climb out.  Run up the steps then jump
and grab the *LEDGE* at the end of the walkway.  Jump again and grab the
overhead *CREVICE* then climb to the left and jump to grab an overhead *LEDGE*.
Climb to the left then jump and grab the *CREVICE* on the left wall.  Move to
the left and have Lara pull herself up onto the small walkway in front of the
door.

Follow the walkway to the very top then blast the bats once Lara reaches the
split bridge through the doorway.  Jump to the other side of the bridge and
walk through the doorway.  Leap to the *WOODEN BAR* on the pillar up ahead to
make the pillar swing around and latch onto the right door of the double doors
below.  Fall off the pillar then fall off either side of the platform (above
the doorways) and drop along the *LEDGES* to get down safely.

LEFT DOORWAY

-- Checkpoint

The pool behind the left doorway has no goodies for Lara so run up the stairs
to the left and jump to the first platform along the side.  Find the first
*LEDGE* on the back wall on the right and jump to it then move to the right and
jump to the next *LEDGE*.  Move to the far right side of the second ledge then
have Lara turn her back and jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the walkway behind her.
Have her pull herself up then race up the walkway through the doorway.  Blast
the bats that attack then jump to the next walkway and walk through the
doorway.  Jump and grab onto the *WOODEN BAR* on the pillar ahead to make the
pillar below latch onto the left door of the double doors below and open both
doors.

-- Checkpoint

Enter the newly opened corridor and follow the twisting halls to stumble upon a
pit area.

-- Checkpoint

EXPLORING THE TWO PITS

Fall along the left side of the pit and grab onto the *LEDGE* to safely make it
to the floor below.  A single wolf will attack at the bottom.  Collect the
++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the middle of the pit then pull out the *METAL CAGE* from
the alcove along the left side of the pit wall.  Position the cage below the
*LEDGE* that Lara dropped from in order to grab onto it again and get back up
on the floor above.

Jump to the platform with the *RAMP* on the wall beside the walkway.  Slide
down the ramp then jump and swing on the *POLE* in front of the ramp.  Jump and
grab the *LEDGE* on the side of the middle piece of walkway then have Lara pull
herself up.  Jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in front of the walkway to have
Lara perch (or stand) on the top of the column.  Lara will start to lose her
balance if on these columns for too long so press the /\ button when required
to help her keep her balance.  Jump to the other side of the walkway while
standing on the column.

On the other side of the walkway another pit will be waiting for Lara.  Jump to
the *LEDGE* across from the walkway then fall to the piece of concrete below
Lara.  Fall into the pit then run to the other side.  Get up on the concrete
piece then jump to the *LEDGE* above and move to the right.  Jump to the *POLE*
attached to the column in front of the right side of the ledge then swing over
to the next *LEDGE* on the opposite wall.  Shimmy to the left then jump and
grab the overhead *LEDGE* and climb across the bottom part of the walkway up
above - don't pull up into the dart trap above.

Pulling up gives a fine view of the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* behind Lara, but Lara
will also have to worry about jumping past the dart trap.  All Lara has to do
is jump in the back of her while hanging (from the middle) to land on the top
of the perchable column.  Jump to the other side of the walkway from the column
and continue down the corridor to the right.  Following this corridor will
eventually end the level.

Walk through the doorway and down and the stairs.

-- Checkpoint

Once Lara drops to the ground below, two wolves will attack from a hidden
alcove off to the right.  Get back on the steps and shoot them or fight them
off normally.  Scope out the area and collect the --COG 1-- on the left side of
the pool below the waterfall.  This will be needed for the gears up above the
ladder to the right of the waterfall.

SECRET AREA

Jump into the pool and swim through the underwater tunnel (it's on the side
across from the waterfall).  Surface once Lara reaches the dead end and pull up
to the floor above to find a ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  Swim back through the water
and surface once again on the other side then climb out.

Step onto the rock where the Cog was found earlier then climb up to the rock
path on the left side.  Jump to the *LEDGE* on the far wall then jump and grab
the *LEDGE* of the platform above and shimmy to the left.  Pull up to the
platform then get up on the next area to find some ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Jump and
grab the right side of the *LEDGE* above then hop over to the *LEDGE* on the
right and shimmy across to the right.  Jump to the *LEDGE* of the platform
above then pull up and grab the next *LEDGE* followed by the *LEDGE* of the top
stairway.  Move to the right while on top and run through the rock tunnel.

-- Checkpoint

MOVING ACROSS THE RIVER

Walk up the steps and jump across to the other side of the broken walkway.
Keep in mind that if Lara falls into the river below, the current will carry
her downstream and she will fall into the pool at the bottom of the waterfall -
in other words, she will have to climb all the way back up to this point.

Hop up the two small *LEDGES* on the right wall then jump to the wooden walkway
in front of the ledges.  Jump and grab onto the ledge on the broken wall then
shimmy all the way across the wall to the left.  Look up and a *RING* will be
visible on the ceiling above.  Jump and grapple to the ring then swing across
to the platform on the right side (adjust Lara a bit while on the grapple).

Hop up to the *LEDGE on the right wall then move to the left and jump to grab
the *LEDGE* above followed by a third *LEDGE*.  Jump to the *LEDGE* of the
right piece of walkway then pull up and walk through the doorway on the right.
Run across the bridge ahead and grab --COG 2-- on the walkway on the other
side.

-- Checkpoint

Two bats will attack Lara after picking up the Cog.  Attack them then shoot the
gold ring that is holding the bridge that Lara just crossed.  This will make
the ring up above the bridge accessible for grappling - don't swing back across
just yet since the secret tunnel that this is connected with will force Lara to
travel back downstream once she collects the goodies.

Walk over to the far end of the walkway and find the *POLE* on the rotating
gear and jump to it.  Have Lara swing and jump to the *LEDGE* on the wooden
structure ahead then shimmy to the right and grab onto the higher *LEDGE*.
Shimmy to the right again then grab the next small *LEDGE* above then hop over
to the *LEDGE* of the front of the walkway behind Lara.  Pull up and enter the
tunnel to the left.  Pull the *SWITCH* at the end on the left side to open a
gate in the water somewhere - this will help Lara to gain the relic for this
level much later.  Shoot the rope holding the planks below - this makes a plank
fall to expose a *POLE* that leads to the area across from Lara, but there's no
use for it now.

-- Checkpoint

Run back to the beginning of the tunnel then hang off the side in front of the
entrance.  Move over to the far right then let go so that Lara grabs the first
*LEDGE* below.  Move to the left on the first ledge then hop back over to the
right *LEDGE* and pull up to the doorway on the right side once again.  Walk to
the other side and hang from the side where the broken bridge is.

Use the broken bridge as a *LADDER* to climb down.  Look off to the right to
see a *LEDGE* below a small opening.  Line up with the opening while on the
bridge then jump and grab the ledge and pull up into the small tunnel above.
Move to the back of the tunnel and pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ and
++SHOTGUN++ at the end.  Return to the front of the tunnel and drop into the
river below.  The current will carry Lara all the way back to the pool below
the waterfall.

A pack of three wolves will attack as Lara pulls up from the waterfall - go
ahead and use the shotgun since some more ammo will be found later.  Climb up
the *LADDER* on the right side of the pool once the wolves are defeated.  Place
the first Cog on the short pole to the side of the switch on the wooden walkway
above then pull the *SWITCH* to start the wooden gears up above.

-- Checkpoint

Jump to the *POLE* on the overhead gear then swing to one of the next *POLES*
on the bigger gear once the Lara moves close enough to either of them.  Swing
from the second pole over to the ladder across from Lara.  Place the second Cog
onto the short pole on the next wooden walkway then pull the next *SWITCH*.
This will start the next set of wooden gears.

-- Checkpoint

There is still one more cog to collect.  Grab onto the *LEDGE* to the right of
the switch then hop across to the next *LEDGE* beside it and move to the right.
Find the overhead *LEDGE* and jump to it hop over to the wooden walkway beside
the ledge.  Don't worry about the rotating wooden platform right now - it leads
to the area where the third cog is placed.

FINDING THE THIRD COG LOCATION

Turn around and jump to the *LEDGE* to the right (when turned) and shimmy all
the way to the right.  Don't jump to the next ledge just yet.  Look down below
and notice the small opening.  Allow Lara to fall while on the far right side
and she will grab onto the *LEDGE* in front of the opening.  Slide down the
ramp in the hidden area and grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the wooden platform.
Slide down the *RAMP* to the side and it will take Lara all the way back to the
bottom.  Climb all the way back up to the ledge that Lara had to release to
gain entry to the small opening.

Jump to the grab the overhead *LEDGE* in front of the rope.  Hop over to the
dangling *ROPE* behind Lara then turn to the left while on the rope to notice
another *LEDGE*.  Swing over to the ledge then move to the right and jump to
the *LEDGE* above the tunnel entrance in front of the walkway below.  Let go of
the ledge and Lara's weight will cause the wooden ladder on the right to
plummet down on the stairs across from the platform and a visible pole will
remain on the plank of the ladder that remains - this pole will be used later.
Walk into the tunnel ahead and climb over the raised rock floor.

-- Checkpoint

Crouch and move under the narrow opening of the wall at the end.  A bear will
dart out of his hiding spot from behind the rock wall ahead and attack Lara
aggressively.  He will actually run back to his hiding spot if Lara tries to
shoot him from the platform on the left side.

Climb to the top of the area above the wooden platform to the left side - use
the wooden *LEDGE* and the next *LEDGE* above it once Lara reaches the corner.
At the very top, grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ on the top wooden
platform.

|                              ARTIFACT (1/2)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| There is an artifact in a hidden alcove right below the platform across     |
| from the wooden platform where the pistol ammo was at.  To reach this       |
| alcove, Lara has to jump on the long ramp below (above where the bear was   |
| hiding) and jump to grab the *LEDGE* across from the alcove (below the      |
| wooden platform with the pistol ammo) in order to get inside the alcove - a |
| piece of the ledge below is on the side facing the ramp.  She has to hit    |
| the precise spot of the ramp (about the middle) in order to jump to the     |
| ledge.                                                                      |

| The best way to jump to the *RAMP* in order to grab onto the ledge is to    |
| jump diagonally in between the column and the small wooden platform.  Jump  |
| when Lara hits the ramp and she will grab onto the piece of the *LEDGE*     |
| below in front of the ramp.  Shimmy to the left on the ledge then jump and  |
| grab the *LEDGE* below the alcove.  Pull up and grab the --ARTIFACT         |
| (1/2)--.  Through the boards along the side of the alcove a Large Medipack  |
| can be seen but that will be collected later.  Climb back to the wooden     |
| platform from earlier.                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Stand on top wooden platform where the pistol ammo was at and find the *LEDGE
on the wall beside the perchable two perchable columns then make a diagonal
jump to it - or climb up the first perchable column and jump to it.  Either
way, jump to grab the next *LEDGE* above the left side of the current ledge
then hop on top of the first *PERCHABLE COLUMN*.  Jump to the next *PERCHABLE
COLUMN* then leap over to the wooden walkway on the other side and slide down
the *RAMP*.  Follow the tunnel ahead with the steps in the back.  The poles to
the side will only lead Lara back to the next area.

THE FIRST PIT

Run up the steps and pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ to the side.  Walk to the
edge of the walkway and jump to the closest ramp then prepare to jump and grab
the *LEDGE* near the bottom.  The pit below Lara is very deep so one fall is
instant death.  Move to the right on the small ledge then jump to grab onto the
side of the wooden platform on the right.  Pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ then
jump to the *POLE* along the wall and swing to the *LEDGE* across from it.
Jump up the *LEDGES* and pull up to the floor above to the left.

-- Checkpoint

THE SECOND PIT

Find the *LEDGE* across from the wooden walkway ahead then jump to it.  Shimmy
around the corner to the left then jump to grab the *LEDGE* across from the
current one and move to the right then drop on the platform.  Bats will attack
so shoot them then grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.

There is a hidden alcove below the platform with the Large Medipack, so hang
off the edge of the pit then drop to the first *LEDGE* on the right side then
drop to the *LEDGE* in front of the hidden alcove.  Pull up and walk inside to
discover yet another ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Use the *LEDGES* against the wall in
front of the alcove to jump back to the floor above - Lara will have to move
over to the left side of the third ledge and jump back to the small ledge on
the side of the platform from earlier.

Climb over the block up ahead and crawl through the narrow space at the top.
Follow the tunnel on the other side until the Checkpoint prompt.

-- Checkpoint

When Lara steps on the wooden portion of the tunnel floor the wood will break
apart and she will slide down a *RAMP* and hit the floor below.  Follow the
misty passage up ahead.

-- Checkpoint

THE LOST VALLEY

Grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ to the right.  Also there is a hidden
++SMALL MEDIPACK++ in the shrubbery in front of the small waterfall on the
right.  Prepare for a fight.  As the music starts to play, three raptors will
run at Lara from up ahead.  The best way to deal with these enemies is to stand
on the rock to the left and blast them with Lara's handguns from there.  They
can get up on the right rock so don't get up on that one.

Another pack of three raptors will attack but Lara has to run forward into the
valley a bit to make them run out from their hiding spots.  Run back to the
same rock or find one of the other rocks in the back of the valley that they
cannot get on and blast them from a safe spot.  There is also another ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ in front of the second waterfall in about the middle of the area.
All of the item pickups in this area must be collected before the second trio
of raptors fall.

-- Checkpoint

A cutscene will play shortly after the checkpoint prompt.  Don't lay down the
controller since this cutscene requires some button presses.

Interactive Cutscene: O - R1 - X

==============================================================================
----------------------------> Boss Battle - T-rex <---------------------------

At the end of the cutscene, Lara will be thrown into battle with the T-rex.
Lock onto him by holding L1 right at the starting and try to stay away from him
as much as possible.  His attacks mainly consist of lunging bites so just jump
or dodge away if he tries to bit Lara.  If Lara gets behind him, he will try to
slap her with his tail.

Notice that he has a life bar and a separate bar displayed below the life bar -
this is the rage bar and it will fill up as he takes damage.  Find one of the
three spiked logs around the area held by two rock pillars and stand in front
of it so that Lara's back is facing it.  Fire the handguns at the T-rex until
his rage bar fills up to the top. Once he becomes fully enraged, he will try to
ram Lara.  Make sure that he is currently locked-on (hold L1) when he runs
toward Lara then dodge out of the way by tapping the O button while holding the
left analog to either of the sides as the screen blurs and then shoot him as
the target marker appears.  When he crashes into a spiked log it will damage
him badly taking about 25% of his health bar.  To easily line Lara up with one
of the spiked logs, back up and find the areas without any grass (lightly
colored dirt) and this will always signify that a log is behind Lara.

Taking advantage of the spiked logs is the quickest way to take damage but just
firing at him with the handguns while he is stunned works well too.  Don't
switch to the shotgun since it is not needed - the handguns work perfectly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Interactive Cutscene: O - R1

-- Checkpoint

Pick up the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ next to the T-rex's body and find the two ++50
CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ pickups - in the very back and in the shrubbery to the
right.  Climb up to the entrance of the building where the T-rex crashed by
moving up the debris on the right side then enter the building.

-- Checkpoint

LEAVING THE LOST VALLEY

Grab --COG 3-- from the platform with the surrounded by water.  Dive down into
the water and find the tunnel on the right side.  Swim through the tunnel and
follow it to the right near the end then surface and pull up.  Grab onto the
*COLUMN* and climb up beside the platform then hop over to it.  Jump up the two
*LEDGES* on the left wall then move to the left on the second ledge and jump to
the very small *LEDGE* to the left.  Leap on top of the *PERCHABLE COLUMN*
behind Lara then jump to the lower *LEDGE* on the wall ahead.  Grab the top
*LEDGE* then move to the right and jump to the *LEDGE* of the walkway across
from Lara and pull up.

Run over to the left side of the lower portion of the building and collect the
++SMALL MEDIPACK++ then return to doorway and use the raised portions and the
debris to climb to the top and move across the top portion of the building.
Drop to the side with the shrubbery then leap over to the next three platforms
and keep moving ahead.  Lara will eventually come to a wooden platform with a
*COLUMN* on it.  Leap to the platform then climb up the column and jump over to
the walkway to the side of the column.

Move to the end of the walkway then jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the green wall
and leap over to the other *LEDGE* then move around the left side.  Jump and
grab the next *LEDGE* to the left then hop over to the wooden bridge behind
Lara.  Follow the bridge to the other side then slide down the *RAMP* and jump
to the *COLUMN* in front of it.  Climb up the column and jump to the broken
portion of the wall.  Fall into the building.

-- Checkpoint

Move ahead and pick up the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ then turn right and some ledges
will be noticeable in the distance.  Don't go that way just yet though - turn
to the right and follow that path outside.  Drop to the wooden platform to the
right and pick up the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ on it then drop to the valley below.
This is the same area where Lara first fought the raptors.  Find the hidden
alcove a bit to the left against the wall and enter it to find a ++LARGE
MEDIPACK++.  Use this time to get any of the items that were left during the
raptor fight if they weren't picked up then.  Climb back on the stone block
then jump to grab the wooden platform once again.  Grab onto the *LEDGE* of the
platform leading into the cave with the ledges from earlier.

Jump to grab the first *LEDGE* then pull up to the platform and jump to the
grab the next *LEDGE* on the platform to the right.  Pull up then run across
the first half of the bridge outside and jump across to the next section.  A
ledge will be off to the left, but first, run into the back of the area and
grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ near the wall then return to the wall near the
bridge and jump to the grab the *LEDGE* on the left side.  Shimmy to the left
while on the ledge then drop to the lower *LEDGE* and continue moving to the
left.  Hop up to the next overhead *LEDGE* then jump to the set of *LEDGES* to
the left and use them to climb up to the concrete platform at the very top.
Move to the end of the platform (with the small waterfall) but don't slide down
the green *RAMP* just yet.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/2)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Leap over to the flat platform past the ramp - Lara will jump a little      |
| higher to make it.  Jump to the next lowest platform on the right side then |
| the next and then drop to the piece of floor with the ARTIFACT (2/2).  Jump |
| back on top of the lowest platform then fall off the other end to be        |
| positioned back on the other end of the wall where the Large Medipack       |
| pickup was located.  Jump back up the ledges to the side of the bridge then |
| get back up to the ramp at the top.                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump on the *RAMP* with the small waterfall trailing down it.  While sliding,
jump near the end of the ramp to land on another *RAMP* then jump to the *POLE*
at the end of the second ramp.  Swing then jump to the next *POLE* then leap to
the *LEDGE* on the side of the wooden platform and pull up.  Jump to the next
wooden platform then enter the tunnel to the side.

-- Checkpoint

Fall off the higher portion of the ground and run down the cave corridor ahead.
Don't move up to the first opening to the right - continue further ahead to the
next opening.

-- Checkpoint

Slide down the *RAMP* then jump and grab the *LEDGE* across from it while
sliding.  Jump to the *LEDGE* behind Lara then release to grab the next low
*LEDGE*.  The left platform leads back to the Lost Valley, so move across to
the right corner and jump to the wooden platform across from the ledge.

-- Checkpoint

Leap to the closest *RAMP* hanging over the next pit then jump to the *LEDGE*
in front of the ramp.  Jump to the overhead *LEDGE* then shimmy to the left and
drop to the next *RAMP*.  While sliding, jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* across
from the ramp and jump to the overhead *LEDGES* to get Lara back up on the
wooden platform on the other side.  Run down the stairs once again.

-- Checkpoint

Climb up the tall *COLUMN* and leap to the ramp then jump to the *PERCHABLE
COLUMN* while sliding.  Jump to the wooden walkway on the other side.  Don't
slide down the ramp just yet!  Notice the opening on the left wall with the
wooden ledges.  Jump toward the first *LEDGE* then drop to the bottom to find a
++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  This is the one that could be seen while retrieving the
first artifact.  Jump back up the ledges then slide down the *RAMP* back up on
the wooden walkway.  Hop over to the wooden platform then climb down the
platforms to the side.  Crouch and move back up under the narrow space to the
side and run back down the tunnel.

-- Checkpoint

PLACING THE THIRD COG

Climb back up over the raised portion of the floor in the tunnel then walk out
onto the wooden walkway ahead.  Turn to the left and jump to the *POLE* on the
plank then swing across to the walkway on the left side of the waterfall.  To
get down quickly, jump into the pool below the waterfall.  Pull up on one of
the sides and climb all the way back up to the rotating wooden platform that
leads to the area where the third cog is placed.  Basically just climb back up
to the side opposite the side Lara was just on - use the ledges to the side of
the second switch then jump to the wooden platform above.

Jump over to the rotating platform when it reaches a horizontal position then
quickly run and leap over to the wooden platform on the other side.  Place the
final cog on the short pole then pull the *SWITCH* to the side.  Setting the
final gear in place will lower the gate and stop the strong current in the
river.  It will also reveal a new doorway on the other side of the waterfall.

-- Checkpoint

Jump back into the pool to get down quickly but don't head toward the new
doorway just yet.  Climb all the way up to the top of the waterfall by climbing
the set of *LEDGES* on the left side of the pool past the rocks on that side.
Crouch and move under the horizontal wooden column of the gate that is blocking
the way on the left side at the top then jump into the river.  There is no
current anymore so swim upstream.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                RELIC (1/1)                                  |
|=============================================================================|
| The tunnel behind the gate that Lara opened all the way back at the         |
| beginning of this area can be now be accessed.  The tunnel is heavily       |
| camouflaged and blends in well with the right wall so just look below the   |
| portion where the switch was to find it - it is below the top portion of    |
| the bridge that is on the right side also.  Just keep looking along the     |
| right wall.  Surface at the end of the tunnel then pull up and collect the  |
| ++KERU MUG RELIC (1/1)++.                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

(If the gate is closed then Lara needs to backtrack all the way to the back of
the river and pull the switch.  See the beginning of this level walkthrough.)

Back outside the tunnel, pull up on the right side of the gate as Lara swims up
to it.  Fall back into the pool on the other side of the gate then walk through
the doorway behind where the big waterfall used to be to finish the level.

Continue through the cave tunnel and Lara will emerge in an area with a room
with a pit up ahead.

-- Checkpoint

Leap on top of the first *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in the pit then jump to the *POLE*.
Swing from the pole then leap on top of the next two *PERCHABLE COLUMNS* and
jump to the lower platform on the other side.  Leap over to the *LEDGE* of the
walkway on the left and pull up.  Enter the next area through the corridor.

-- Checkpoint

TOMB OF QUALOPEC

Walk toward the doorway on the other side of the stone bridge and walk up the
ramp a bit then quickly run back out and move to either side as a boulder
starts to roll down the ramp past the doorway.  The boulder will hit the stone
bridge and destroy the section closest to the doorway.  This will allow Lara to
move the wooden pillar with the wooden platform on top from that side.  Three
gates will crash down once the boulder has destroyed the bridge.

FINDING THE FIRST SWITCH

Walk back to the middle of the stone bridge and find the three *LEDGES* on the
back right side the hand off the side of the floor and drop to the bottom of
the pit using the ledges to drop safely.  Push the *WOOD BLOCK* below the set
of ledges that Lara just dropped from in order to reach them when she needs to
get out.  Pick up the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from near the wooden column to
the side.

Grab the *WOODEN PILLAR* and push it over to the light circle of dirt on the
left side of the pit (assuming you're staring from the entrance of this area).
Get on the wood block and jump back up the three *LEDGES* in order to get back
on top of the bridge.  Jump to the top of the wooden pillar then jump to the
*LEDGE* on the right and pull up.  Hop up to the next *LEDGE* on the left wall
then move around the corner to the left and jump up to the next *LEDGE*.  Jump
over toward the *LEDGES* on the right and Lara will automatically perform a
diagonal jump toward the bottom ledge - jump to the next then pull up.  Leap
over to the column next to the top of the doorway with three sealed gates then
jump to the top of the doorway.

Aim at the ring in helping to suspend the emblem up above the stone bridge then
fire to make the emblem crash down on top of the other side of the stone bridge
and destroy that side.  This will make another wooden pillar below that Lara
can now move.  Look on the ceiling above and two gold *RINGS* are now visible.
Jump and grapple to the first then jump and grapple to the next.  Lower Lara
just a bit on the second ring so that she is lined up with the alcove on the
other side then swing over to it and jump inside.  Pull the *SWITCH* on the far
wall inside the alcove to open the first (outer) gate of the doorway below.

-- Checkpoint

GOING FOR THE SECOND SWITCH

Hang off the side of the alcove then drop back down below.  Hop back over to
the wooden pillar that Lara previously moved on the left side then jump and
grab the *LEDGE* below the left doorway and pull up.  Use the second wooden
pillar to make two stepping platforms leading to the left doorway if the jumps
seem too hard to make - the bridge is smaller now, so the jump is harder to
make with just one though it can done with well timed jumps.  Run down the
corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

Pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Perform a well timed run and jump to move past
the arrow trap and jump over to the *POLE* up ahead.  Swing and jump to the
*LEDGE* on the wall then jump to the next *LEDGE* on the left.  Perform some
well timed jumps to grab onto the next two *LEDGES* then hop over to the
*LADDER* on the wall across from Lara.  Climb to the top then jump and grab
onto the next two *LEDGES* to the right.  Jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in
front of the second ledge then leap to the walkway on the other side.  Grab the
++SMALL MEDIPACK++ and run down the corridor to the right.  Lara will run
across another ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ along the way.

-- Checkpoint

Carefully run past the next two arrow traps then turn right and continue down
the corridor.  Find the gold *RING* above and jump then grapple to it and swing
to the broken section of stairs in the middle of the area.  A switch will be
visible on the far wall but Lara can't jump to it just yet.  Turn to the left
and jump to grab the *COLUMN* then leap to the *POLE*.  Jump to the *LEDGES*
and use them to get up on top of the wooden walkway above.  Grab the ++50
CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ off to the right then jump and grab onto the *LEDGE*
above the switch on the far wall.  Fall down and allow Lara to grab onto the
*SWITCH*.  This will open the second (inner) gate back in the middle room with
the stone bridge.

-- Checkpoint

GOING FOR THE THIRD SWITCH

Return to the middle room with the stone bridge.  More arrow traps in the
corridor outside of the switch room have been activated so run and roll through
them carefully.  Arrow traps and pendulums are now blocking the second portion
of the corridor once Lara turns left - use proper timing to run or roll past
them.

-- Checkpoint

Directly after the checkpoint following the pendulums a familiar screech will
occur from up ahead and a raptor will dash toward Lara from the corridor in
front of her.  Blast the raptor then grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ past the
doorway.

Jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* past the arrow trap at the end of the corridor
then jump to the *LEDGES* on the wall.  Jump along the *LEDGES* and the
*LADDER* while moving to the left along the wall then jump across to the
*LEDGE* on the other wall and have Lara work her way over to the *POLE* so she
can swing back to the walkway on the other side.

-- Checkpoint

Back in the middle room with the stone bridge, hang off the wooden pillar then
drop below.  Grab the wooden pillar and drag it over to the other side of the
pit (right side).  Drag the other wooden pillar over to the right side as well
to make two stepping platforms across to the right side doorway.  Push one of
them right up against the entrance - as far as it can go - then push the other
a little ways away from the first while keeping it in line with the stone
bridge above.  Hop across once they are positioned and follow the corridor.

-- Checkpoint

Lara will eventually come to a pit.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/2)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Find the white piece of floor forming a *LEDGE* on the current side then    |
| hang off and drop down into the pit by falling along the *LEDGES*.  Walk to |
| the far side of the pit then turn to the right (the right of the back       |
| column) to find the first --ARTIFACT (1/2)--.  Climb up the *COLUMN*        |
| closest to the set of ledges then jump back out of the pit.                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump past the first arrow trap and land on the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* then hop to
the *LEDGE* on the left wall followed by the *LEDGE* to the right of that one
when there is a break in the arrows.  Drop to the lower *LEDGE* then move to
the right and leap over to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in front of the lower ledge.
Jump to the walkway and follow the corridor ahead into the room at the end.

-- Checkpoint

Grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ to the left right after walking through the doorway.
Prepare for a big surprise as Lara walks toward the switch in the back.

== SPOILER
The floor will crumble underneath Lara and she will slide down into a pit below
the switch.  Draw her guns while falling since there are two wolves in the pit.
== END SPOILER

Move up either ramp along the sides of the pit and pull the cage out of the
wall on the top walkway.  Push it off the side of the walkway and push it next
to the right pillar below so that Lara can get on top and jump to the *LEDGE*
on the side of the pillar.  Hop up to the next *LEDGE* then leap across the two
*COLUMNS* in the back of Lara.  Jump over to the *LEDGE* on the other pillar
then move around the corner to the right and jump to the *POLE* across from the
ledge.  Swing on the pole and grab onto the *LEDGE* of the platform ahead.

-- Checkpoint

Pull up and jump up the next two *LEDGES* on the wall then move to the right
and hop across to the *COLUMN*.  Climb near the top of the column but don't
jump to the switch just yet.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/2)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| While on the column, look on the wall to the left of the switch to see two  |
| openings in the wall.  Jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the floor of the right  |
| opening and pull up then grab the --ARTIFACT (2/2)-- to the left.  Hop back |
| over to the column that Lara was on.                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump to the *LEDGE* above the switch then fall and allow Lara to grab onto the
*SWITCH* and this will lift open the third (middle) gate back in the middle
room with the stone bridge.

To get back across the pit safely, while still hanging on the switch, jump to
the *POLE* on the right then hop over to the *LEDGE* on the wall.  Move to the
left so Lara can put her feet up on the wall then jump to the overhead *LEDGE*
then move to the right and jump to the next *LEDGE* and pull up into the
opening.  From the other side of the opening, jump back down to the steps in
front of the pit.

-- Checkpoint

ENTERING THE TOMB OF QUALOPEC

Begin the journey back to the middle room by running down the corridor.  Once
the familiar screech begins, run back to the entrance fire at the raptor that
attacks then continue ahead.  There is a raptor in the pit along the way but
her can be avoided.  Jump to the first *PERCHABLE COLUMN* then jump to grab
onto the *POLE* hanging above the middle of the pit.  Swing and jump through
the arrow trap to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* and Lara will be able to grab onto the
*COLUMN* portion below the top of the perchable column.  Jump toward the
*LEDGES* on the other side to get back to the other side of the walkway safely.

-- Checkpoint

Hop back across the wooden pillars and enter the newly opened doorway in the
middle of the room.  Run up the two ramps past the doorway and enter the room
at the top.

-- Checkpoint

Walk toward the pedestal to trigger a cutscene.

-- Checkpoint

The tomb is now crumbling but there is not time limit involved while making it
out of this tomb.  Run down both ramps once again then jump to the entrance of
the stone bridge room and continue.

-- Checkpoint

Jump to the platform.  There is a raptor in the pit but there is no reason to
fall into the pit so he can be skipped.  Shoot him from the safety of the
platform to kill him easily.  Jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMNS* and the *POLE* to
make it across the pit safely.

-- Checkpoint

Run through the tunnel through the doorway on the left and move toward the
entrance that the waterfall was previously guarding for a set of cutscene that
will lead into the next level.

PILLAR AREA

Walk further into the building ahead and two lions will dart out from behind
the pillars in the back and attack.  Fight them like a raptor - fire and
concentrate on dodging their rage attacks then cap them in the head.  A
cutscene will trigger after the second lion is killed.

-- Checkpoint

This area can be very tricky during a first playthrough since there are so many
crevices to choose from along the pillars.  Step on the circular *PRESSURE
PLATE* in the middle of the pillars and the camera will zoom in on the gate
above to show it opening.  Face the other way and notice the big metal sphere
up on the high platform above - that is the next destination.  As Lara steps
off the pressure plate the gate up above will close once again, so something
has to be placed on it to keep that gate open - see where this is going?

Walk toward the overhead gate and move around the back end of the pillar on the
right side.  Jump and grab onto the *CREVICE* on the back of the pillar then
shimmy to the right and hop up to the next *CREVICE* then the next *CREVICE*
and finally the top of the pillar.  Facing the gate, jump and grab onto the
middle *CREVICE* of the pillar to the left (this is the largest pillar in the
area).  Shimmy around it and use the next two overhead *CREVICES* to reach the
top.  Leap over to the pillar across from the walkway with the two fences.
Jump over to the walkway after landing on the pillar.  Notice that there is a
gate blocking the way to an artifact off to the side - the gate has to be
opened through a puzzle.

Move back on the walkway and walk over to the right side of walkway then jump
to the next lowest walkway.  On the other side of the lower walkway, a ring
will be visible from above.  These type of rings will allow Lara to wall run on
the wall below them.  Jump toward the *RING* and grapple to it to have Lara run
along the wall.  She can move up and down on the grapple by pressing the /\
button and adjusting herself while on the rope just like during a swing.  She
can jump to the area behind her by tapping the jump button while her legs are
on the ground - it is not needed at the moment but this will be useful later.
Press back and forth on the analog while attached to the ring then jump toward
the opening on the other side once Lara builds up enough momentum while
running.  Approach the mural on the wall.

-- Checkpoint

++ MURAL PUZZLE

This mural will allow Lara perform many tasks at the beginning of this level.
Step on the *PRESSURE PLATE* in front of the mural to close all the lighted
circles on the figure.  Walk over to the other side of this area to find
another mural with lighted circles displayed on it.  Run back to the middle
mural and auto aim Lara's guns at the display then shoot the unlit circles so
that they light up and match the other mural.  Use the right analog to cycle
through the different unlit circles.

Here is the light circles displayed on the first mural:

MURAL #1 (2 lights)

- The left eye of the severed head
- The blade of the sword

Shoot these on the middle mural and the other mural will rise up into the
ceiling.

-- Checkpoint

Walk over to the newly opened side then jump and grapple to the *RING* on the
wall above and wall run over to the walkway up ahead.  Leap and grab onto the
next walkway then pull up and find the next mural on the floor past the two
fences.

This one has the following display:

MURAL #2 (4 lights)

- the back of the hand that holds the sword
- the lower back of the figure
- the bottom of the right foot
- the left foot

Backtrack to the area with the mural then step on the pressure plate to cover
the light once again.  Fire at the unlit lights displayed on mural #2 to open
the gate in front of the mural.

-- Checkpoint

Walk through the newly opened doorway.  Grapple ([]) either ring on the side of
the metal sphere then tug (/\) each of them to pull out the middle bar that
keeps the sphere in place.

-- Checkpoint

The sphere will roll off the pedestal.  Move over to the *SPHERE* and grab it
(/\) then roll it off the side of the walkway and onto the floor below.

|=============================================================================|
| Now, about that artifact lying behind the gate, the mural that shows the    |
| correct sequence of lights will not be found until Lara has entered the     |
| area past the gate on the other side, which means that she will have to     |
| backtrack (climb) all the way back up all those pillars, but she is here    |
| right now, so why not cheat just a bit!  The combination is both of the     |
| other lighted patterns combined along with the right knee.                  |
|                                                                             |

| alcove.                                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In order to get down very easily, grapple to either of the rings on the outside
walls then move down the grapple and drop when Lara is near the bottom.  Move
the metal *SPHERE* over on top of the *PRESSURE PLATE* in the middle of the
pillar area in order to open the gate up above.

-- Checkpoint

In order to get up to the newly opened doorway, climb back up the pillar to the
right (of the open gate) using the crevices then hop back over to the crevice
on the tallest pillar beside the current pillar.  Move along the crevices and
climb to the top once again.  While on top, face the platform in front of the
gate and leap over to the platform - Lara will not lose any health while
falling to the platform.

Run through the doorway and find the *RING* on the left wall then jump and
grapple to it.  Have Lara lower herself while on the grapple and keep an eye
for a hidden platform on the left wall while lowering.  Line Lara up with the
end of the platform then wall run and jump to it to find a ++LARGE MEDIPACK++
on it.  Drop off the platform.

The *PRESSURE PLATE* in front of the door will open the back gate, but Lara
needs to place something on it to keep the gate from closing when she steps off
of it.  Look above the door with the switch to the right (on the ceiling) of it
to see the third mural display that is needed to open the gate that leads to
the first artifact.  Pull the *SWITCH* to the right of the door to open the
door.

-- Checkpoint

Run through the door and shoot the lions when they dart out from behind the
pillars.  Grab the *SPHERE* and roll it through the newly opened doorway and
place it on top of the other *PRESSURE PLATE* inside the building to open the
gate ahead.

-- Checkpoint

Run down the stairs and Lara will emerge in a very tall room.  Look at how deep
it is below the walkway!

-- Checkpoint

================================= EXTRA INFO ==================================

To start off here is an explanation of how to get up and down this colossal
room.

Going to the bottom floor:

Jump to the walkway in the middle then hang off and fall to the piece of
walkway debris on the left portion.  Find the small piece of walkway with a
ledge below it then jump over to it and fall down to the *LEDGES* then the
piece of walkway debris below.  Climb down the *LADDER* off to the right then
drop to the piece of walkway below.

Jump to the *LEDGE* across from the walkway then drop.  Damocles door will to
the side as Lara lands.  Find the *LADDER* next to the piece of walkway debris
and climb down it.  Jump to the *LEDGE* to the left of the ladder and shimmy to
the left then drop to the piece of walkway below.  Fall off the walkway to fall
to the bottom floor unharmed.

Climbing all the way back to the top floor from the bottom:

Jump on top of the lowest piece of walkway (with shotgun ammo) then turn and
jump to the piece of walkway on the left.  Jump to the *LEDGE* above the
walkway then shimmy to the right and leap over to the *LADDER* on the right
side.  Climb up the ladder then get on top of the piece of walkway debris to
the left and jump to the nearest *LEDGE* on the pillar up ahead to the left.
Shimmy all the way around the right corner then jump to the overhead *LEDGE*.
Move to the right on the ledge and jump to the piece of walkway on the right.

From the walkway, look to the side then jump to the walkway in between the two
pillars to the left.  Jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* on the left pillar then
shimmy over to the overhead *LEDGE* on the right and jump to the grab on.  Move
to the left and hop over to the *LEDGE* on the left side then jump to the
overhead *LEDGE* of the floor above and pull up after moving to the right -
Lara will face the Atlas room upon pulling up.

Get on top of the walkway debris to the right then jump to the *LEDGE* on the
pillar to the side and hop up then climb to the walkway above.  Jump over to
the walkway on the left side then jump to the *LEDGE* on the left pillar and
shimmy around the corner to the left.  Jump up to the overhead *LEDGE* then
jump and grab onto the top walkway and pull up.

================================= EXTRA INFO ==================================

Look to the left and right to see a switch on each wall.  This room requires
Lara to open up four doorways and enter through each of those four doorways in
order to retrieve a key after performing the trials in each room.  The four
keys are used to open the door at the very bottom of this room.

Hop (jump and grab on) over to the middle walkway in the middle.  Walk to the
end of the right piece of walkway and notice the platforms below with the rings
on the ends - one of them is still inside of the wall.  Throw out Lara's
grapple toward the *RING* on hidden platform and pull it out (/\).

OPENING THE POSEIDON DOOR

Leap over to the platform that Lara just pulled out of the wall then hop over
to the left platform and then jump to the alcove to the right.  Jump and grab
the *POLE* on the side wall and swing across to the walkway.  Run up the stairs
and pull the *SWITCH* in the middle to open the Poseidon door below.

-- Checkpoint

Once the door opens bats will fly out and eventually attack Lara.  A platform
will also move out of the floor from the walkway in front of the switch.  Walk
out onto the platform (kill the bats) then hop back across to the middle
walkway.  The right alcove across from the platform that Lara drug out of the
wall will only lead to the Atlas door which is closed for the moment.

Hang off the left side of the middle walkway and drop to the piece of walkway
debris below then hop over to the piece of walkway in the back.  There is a
button on the far wall, above a gray pillar.  Shoot the *BUTTON* to extend a
platform on the side of the wall below the button.  This platform will lead
Lara to the Hephaestus door, but it is still closed at the moment.

Turn to the left and find the gray column with the *RING* along the top side
then grapple it and pull it to make it fall on the walkway below.  Hang off the
piece of walkway that Lara is currently on and drop down the *LEDGE* along the
side then fall to the piece of walkway debris below.  Grapple the *RING* of the
column on the wall to the side and pull the column down.  The column will land
on the next floor of the walkway below Lara, but don't go down to it.

OPENING THE HEPHAESTUS DOOR

Turn to the first column that fell and climb on top then move across it - it
will start to sink a bit when Lara first get on but it won't fall.  Collect the
++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the raised platform to the side then turn and jump to
the *LEDGE* of the platform across from the current one.  Climb up the raised
floor then jump up to the *LEDGE* on the wall at the end.  Shimmy to the left
around the corner then hop up to the next *LEDGE* and move left.  Jump to the
grab the *LEDGE* of the walkway above then pull up.  Run up the stairs and pull
the middle *SWITCH*.

-- Checkpoint

Pulling the switch will open the Hephaestus door and extend a platform in front
of the switch that will allow Lara to jump back to the middle walkway.  Shoot
the bats as they attack on the way back over to the middle walkway.  Drop back
down one floor and jump over to the platform that is in front of the button
that Lara shot (the platform that extended when the button was shot).

Jump diagonally to the small *LEDGE* on the wall to the right of the platform -
it doesn't look like Lara can make this jump but she jumps a bit higher when
aiming for this ledge.  Hop over to the next *LEDGE* to the right then pull up.
Jump and grab the *POLE* to the side of the current area then swing and jump to
the small *LEDGE* along the wall up ahead.  Move to the left then drop to the
*LEDGE* of the walkway below.  Pull up then crouch and move under the broken
portion of the wall.  Hang off the side of the *LEDGE* on the current floor
then shimmy over to the right and pull up in front of the open Hephaestus door.
Walk through the open doorway.

-- Checkpoint

EXPLORING THE HEPHAESTUS ROOM

Pull the *SWITCH* on the wall to the right and stand away from the gate as it
opens.  Traps will smash together and the gate will fall.  Turn around and look
for the lowest ledge on the right wall.  Grab the *LEDGE* then jump up to the
overhead *LEDGE* and move to the right then jump to the next *LEDGE* above and
continue to the right.  At the end, hold back and jump to make Lara jump and
turn in midair then grab the small walkway above the doorway where the gate
fell.  Pull up and hang off the other side then drop to the *LEDGE* on the gate
below and drop to the other side.  Run down the corridor ahead to emerge in a
new room.

-- Checkpoint

The metal ball attached to the ceiling above will electrify the tiles below,
but it will only electrify the tiles that move upward each time.  Several tiles
will move upward while others stay on ground level.  Four pressure tiles along
the floor will remain upward.  The object here is to step on each of the
*PRESSURE TILES* while avoiding the raised tiles.  Once this deed is fulfilled,
the gate in the three gates in the back will raise and allow Lara into the room
ahead.

-- Checkpoint

The Key of Hephaestus that Lara needs is behind a gate in the middle of this
new room.  Grab the *STATUE BUST* to the right and pull it over to one of the
small circular holes in front of the diamond shaped markings in the center of
the room.  Make sure the statue faces the middle.

Notice the painting of the figure with the hammer on the floor in front of the
pressure plate - grab the *BLOCK* off to the left and push it on top of the
*PRESSURE PLATE* on the left side.  A giant hammer will fall down and destroy
the block revealing a hidden statue bust.  Grab the back of the *STATUE BUST*
and pull it off the pressure plate (the hammer won't smash Lara at this time)
then pull the bust over to one of the other circular holes by the diamond
shaped markings and place it inside then make it face the middle.

This next part can get a bit dangerous.  Stand on the *PRESSURE PLATE* below
the hammer then quickly move out of the way of the hammer's path (stand to the
right of the hammer) and jump and grab onto the hammer.  Jump up the *LEDGES*
along the side of the hammer and pull up then quickly run to the other end and
leap over to the high walkway with the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on it - this jump has
to be timed very well since Lara cannot grab onto the side of the walkway.
Fall back down and perform the same method again but this time move to the left
side of the hammer.  Jump to the *POLE* then leap across to the middle
platform.

(A good way to stand on the pressure plate long enough so that it actually
falls while giving Lara enough time to move is to stand on either the right or
left of the pressure plate then run to the opposite side.)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/6)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Walk into the alcove in the back of the platform and look to the left to    |
| find an ARTIFACT (2/6).                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump and swing on the next *POLE* then hop over to the walkway on the other
side.  Grab the *BLOCK* to the right and push it off the middle right portion
of the walkway and it will fall and break to reveal another *STATUE BUST*.
Grab the statue bust and pull it over to the final circular hole then make it
face the middle like the others.  The pressure plate below the hammer will rise
just a bit more.

Walk back over to the *PRESSURE PLATE* and stand on it then quickly run off to
make the hammer swing down once again and hit the pressure plate and open the
gate to the key in the middle and the gate that will allow Lara to leave this
room.  Walk over to the newly opened alcove in the middle and grab the --KEY OF
HEPHAESTUS-- from the pedestal inside.

-- Checkpoint

Go back through the room with the electric tiles then pull the *SWITCH* in the
corridor with the closed gate.  Quickly grab onto the *LEDGE* on the middle of
the gate as it starts to rise.  As the gate rises all the way, count four beats
as the timer counts down for the gate to close then jump directly after the
fourth beat and Lara will grab onto the *LEDGE* of the walkway above as the
gate comes crashing down.  Pull up then hang from the other side and fall down
to get back to the other side safely.  Run through the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

A platform will extend out of the floor ahead and allow Lara to jump back
across to the middle set of walkways.  In order to get back across, Lara must
jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* on the right pillar of the middle walkway
structure.  Move around the corner to the right while on the ledge then fall to
the *LEDGE* below and continue to the right then pull up.

Lara is now facing the Atlas door - this is the next door to be opened.  Climb
down the ladder to the left and drop to the piece of walkway below.  Fall to
the piece of walkway debris below the current walkway.  Find the hidden
platform on the side wall with the *RING* on the front of it and grapple it
then pull it out of the wall.  The hidden platform is used to reach the
Poseidon door, which should be open if Lara pulled the switch that opened this
door up above earlier.

Leap over to the new platform then jump diagonally over to the *LEDGE* on the
right side of the wall (same wall with the platform).  Leap over to the very
small *LEDGE* on the right then hop over to the next set of *LEDGES* on the
right and climb upward.  Climb on top of the raised portion of the wall then
crouch and move under the space in the wall and Lara will eventually be
standing in front of the Poseidon door.  Walk through the tunnel ahead.

-- Checkpoint

POSEIDON ROOM

Pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall once the gate is reached then quickly run
over to the gate and grab onto the *LEDGE* in the middle of it.  The gate will
open with Lara still hanging from it.  Right after four beats when the gate is
about to close again jump straight up and grab the *LEDGE* of the space above
the gate and pull up then fall to the other side.  Three rats will attack Lara
once she lands.  Proceed through the tunnel ahead and enter the room with the
pool in the middle.

-- Checkpoint

Walk behind the back right pillar and pick up the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ behind it.
Leap into the middle pool and swim to the very bottom then pull the *LEVER* on
the wall next to the gate to open the gate and quickly swim through tunnel past
the gate then surface at the end.  Pull up and walk into the next room with a
surrounding pool.

-- Checkpoint

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/6)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Jump into the water and find the *LEVER* on the back of the middle pillar   |
| then pull it to open a gate right above the water.  Swim back to the top    |
| and pull up to the alcove that was previously closed off and grab the       |
| --ARTIFACT (3/6)--.                                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Swim over to the walkway on the left side and collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.
Move behind the middle pillar with the lever along the side (Lara can't pull it
yet) and climb up on top of the broken back portion then jump to the *LEDGE* up
above and pull up.  Hop up to the next overhead *LEDGE* on the pillar then
shimmy to the left and jump to grab onto the *LEDGE* of the walkway above the
pillar then pull up.

Walk over the statue of the first walkway on the left side and pick up the ++50
CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ then grab the small *BLOCK* in front of the statue and
pull it away from the statue.  Pulling the block away from the statue will
raise the water level to the current walkway that Lara is standing on.  Notice
the alcove to the right of this walkway (while standing on the bridge portion)
with the ledge below it - keep this in mind for later since it will help Lara
to reach the key beyond the middle gate.  Swim over to the opposite side with
the lone block where the walkway is broken then pull up to that side.  Grab the
*BLOCK* and push it into the water.

Dive down into the water and find the switch on the front of the pillar across
from the entrance where Lara first entered the area and pull it.  This will
open a gate at the very bottom and release a *WOODEN PLATFORM* but the platform
will get stuck beneath a walkway on while floating to the top.  Return to the
fish statue that Lara removed the block from the front of and push the block
back in front of the gush of water that the fish is spouting to lower the water
level once again - make sure to push the block directly toward the water spout
of the water will push it back.  Fall down the side of the *LEDGES* along the
pillar (across from the entrance) to get back down to the first floor.  The
block that Lara pushed into the water from the top is sitting next to the fish
statue on the current floor so walk over to the *BLOCK* and push it in front of
the water spout that the fish is spraying to make the water lower even more.

To get down safely, hang off the circular walkway next to the small pool that
Lara surfaced to enter this area and climb over to the *LEDGE* on the right
side (while facing the pool) then drop to the *CREVICE* below.  Drop to the
piece of walkway debris below the crevice then fall below.  Grapple the *WOODEN
PLATFORM* in the shallow water and pull it all the way over to the broken
walkway debris on the opposite side.  Place it right above the gate with the
lever on the pillar above it.  The object here is to pull it over below the
alcove high above.

Climb back up the *LEDGES* that Lara used to drop to the bottom floor then pull
the *BLOCK* away from the front of the fish once again on the above floor to
raise the water level.  Find the alcove with the ledge below it up above and
position the *WOODEN PLATFORM* below that alcove - pull it below the drain pipe
below the alcove.  Climb back up the *LEDGES* on the middle pillar then pull
out the *BLOCK* from the front of the statue on this floor to raise the water
level once again.

Jump to the wooden platform while it is positioned below the alcove then hop
over to the *LEDGE* below the alcove and pull up.  Leap to the *LEDGE* on the
right wall then shimmy to the right and jump to the next *LEDGE* on the right
above the gate.  Move over the to the small opening above the gate and pull up
into it then fall into the alcove past the gate.  Grab the --KEY OF POSEIDON--
then pull the *SWITCH* on the left wall to lower the gate.

-- Checkpoint

Push the block back in front of the fish statue on the top level so Lara
doesn't have to swim through as much water on the way back.  Jump into the
water below then pull up to the walkway and jump back into the pool that Lara
entered this area from.  Swim back through the tunnel and pull up into the room
at the top.

-- Checkpoint

Walk over to the *SWITCH* on the right wall near the gate and pull it then
quickly grab onto the *LEDGE* on the gate.  When the gate raises up count for
beats then jump up as the gate falls and grab the *LEDGE* of the walkway above
then move through it and fall to the other side.  Run back through the tunnel
at the beginning.

-- Checkpoint

The platform outside the Poseidon door will extend.  Walk to the end of the
platform then jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the right pillar of the central
walkway structure.  Shimmy to the left then drop to the walkway below.  Find
the ladder on the side of the walkway (straight ahead) and climb down it then
drop to the bottom floor.  Move up either stairway along the sides of the
bottom floor and pull the *SWITCH* at the top.  This switch will open the Atlas
door near the top.

Climb the entire walkway structure and get back to the top.  Be sure to grab
the *SHOTGUN AMMO* on the piece of walkway debris on the bottom floor while
climbing.  See the "Climbing all the way back to the top floor from the bottom"
portion of this stage walkthrough to help get back to the top.  Don't worry
about the second fallen column while climbing since that will be explored later
- it leads to the Damocles room.

Back at the top, jump to the first platform with the ring on the right side
(while facing both of them) - this is the one that Lara pulled out at the
beginning of this area.  Hop over to the *LEDGE* on the right side then drop to
the platform below.  Hang off the side of the platform and move to the right
then drop to grab the *LEDGE* on the right side below the current one.  Move to
the right over the ramp then fall onto the *RAMP* and jump to the *LEDGE*
directly across from the ramp before reaching the bottom.  Move to the left
then drop and catch onto the *LEDGE* of the walkway below then pull up -
remember where this ledge is for when Lara exits the Atlas room since it will
be used to get a artifact as well as open the Damocles room!  Enter the through
the Atlas door to the left.

-- Checkpoint

ATLAS ROOM

At the gate, pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall then quickly run over and grab
the *LEDGE* on the middle of the gate.  Once it rises jump up to the *LEDGE* of
the opening above the gate after three beats of timer.  Fall to the other side
then run down the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

Enter the room up ahead with the pit to the side.  Grab the two-handled *CRANK*
and rotate it counterclockwise to make the two platforms along the pit to the
side extend from the floor and join together creating a walkway across the pit.
Once Lara release the crank, the platforms will slowly move back into the wall,
so quickly run and jump over them to get to the other side before they retract.

Move about halfway up the long ramp on the other side and find the small
*LEDGE* on the left wall then jump to it.  Jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the left
then move to the left and grab the overhead *LEDGE* of the platform above.
Grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ then fall to the walkway with the *SWITCH*
on the far wall then pull the switch.  Pulling the switch will cause a pole to
extend over the pit on both sides.

-- Checkpoint

There is a raised area on the opposite side, but the goodies on that side will
be obtained in just a moment once another obstacle has been made available.
Approach the statue of Atlas at the very top of the ramp.  The spikes below the
statue will damage Lara if she comes into contact with them.  Shoot the button
on each side of the wall behind the statue of Atlas to make the spikes retract
with each shot and make the statue drop the giant metal globe on its back.
Quickly run back to the pit and jump then grab onto the *POLE* above the pit
and leap to the other side - do not swing more than one time (tap the jump
button as soon as Lara grab onto the pole).  The camera will be in front of
Lara the whole time and she cannot afford to stumble at all during this
sequence.  The globe will smash through the pole and roll into the pit.

Rotate the *CRANK* once again then move across the walkway to the other side.
Run up the ramp and collect the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ at the top along with the
--KEY OF ATLAS-- on the pillar from the alcove below the statue of Atlas.  Run
back down the ramp and look off to the left to notice that the globe damaged
the pillar on the left side.  Step up to the block below the pillar then climb
up to the top of the pillar.  Jump and grab the side of the walkway above and
collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++

| Grab onto the *LEDGE* on the high platform to the left and pull up then     |
| grab the --ARTIFACT (4/6)-- hidden behind the rocks.  Drop back down the    |
| ledge to the walkway below.                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Pull the *SWITCH* on the wall to the right to make the platforms below join
together again and allow Lara back across.  Quickly drop back down to the ramp
and hurry across the platform since they will start to retract after a few
seconds.  Run back down the left tunnel to the side.

-- Checkpoint

Pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall when Lara reaches the gate once again then
quickly grab onto the *LEDGE* in the center of the gate.  The gate will rise
and will stay suspended into the air until Lara jumps off of it.  Jump to the
*POLE* behind Lara and the gate will fall.  Turn around while on the pole then
swing to the opening up above the gate.  Fall to the other side and run through
the tunnel ahead.

-- Checkpoint

A platform will extend as Lara reaches the entrance just like with all the
other room but do not walk on it.  Walk over to the left side upon exiting the
Atlas door and hang off the far left side of the walkway.  Drop to the *LEDGE*
below the walkway and shimmy to the left across it - moving under the platform.
Jump to the next *LEDGE* on the left then shimmy to the far left and turn to
jump away from the ledge so that Lara grabs onto the *POLE* on the slanted wall
to the left.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (5/6)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| While on the pole, swing over to the walkway on the side of the wall then   |
| hop up to the raised portion and grab the --ARTIFACT (5/6)-- on top.  Hop   |
| back over to the *POLE* then swing back over to the *LEDGE* that Lara was   |
| just on.                                                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Move to the far left of the *LEDGE* once again if Lara isn't there already then
drop to the *LEDGE* below and drop once again to catch onto the *LEDGE* of the
side of the grayish wall below.  Pull up then jump over to the *LEDGE* of the
platform to the right (while looking toward the middle).  Pull up and grab onto
the high *LEDGE* on the very top of the left wall.  Shimmy over to the left
then jump to the left *LEDGE*.  Move to the left some more then drop and grab
onto the *LEDGE* below the platform with a switch.  Pull up and activate the
*SWITCH* to open the Damocles door.

-- Checkpoint

Fall down the *LEDGES* in front of the switch to reach the bottom floor once
again.  Start to climb back up the central walkway structure - up the *LEDGES*
along the pillar, up the *LADDER*, up the next two *LEDGES* after jumping from
the piece of walkway debris then finally jump to the suspended walkway piece
and over to the walkway with the fallen pillar leaning against it.  Jump onto
the pillar (it will sink a bit but not fall) and cross it.

Jump onto the *LEDGE* on the raised platform to the right then grab the metal
*CAGE* and pull it away from it's current position (to the left).  Hang off the
*LEDGE* on the walkway then jump to the right *LEDGE* and move to the right
across the ledge then drop to the platform below.  Collect the ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ from the platform then jump back across via the ledges and move over
to the other metal cage on the opposite side.  Grab the second metal *CAGE* and
push it into the left wall.

Leap back over to the second cage and get on top of it.  Walk to the left end
of the cage then jump and grab onto the high *LEDGE* on the left wall.  Shimmy
to the left across the wall then drop to the *LEDGE* below.  Move to the right
and the metal cage positioned below will allow Lara to put her feet on the wall
and allow her to jump across to the left *LEDGE*.  Move to the right and drop
to the *LEDGE* below then drop again and pick up the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ on the
platform.  Hang off the side of the platform then drop the *LEDGE* below and
shimmy to the right then drop again.  Hang off the side of the wall then jump
to the right walkway in front of the Damocles door.  Walk through the doorway.

-- Checkpoint

DAMOCLES ROOM

(Read the Glitch mention below before you tackle this part)

The gate cannot be opened at the moment since there is a concrete block that
keeps it from rising all the way.  Fortunately the block has a *RING* on it
that Lara's grapple can cling to, so look up and grapple the block then pull it
out of the wall.  Make sure to stand away from the block so it doesn't fall on
Lara.  Flip the *SWITCH* on the right wall then quickly push the *BLOCK* up
under the gate to keep it from closing.  Climb on top of the block then jump to
the *LEDGE* in the center of the gate and finally grab onto the opening above
the gate.  Pull up and fall to the other side then move down the corridor
ahead.

* Bug Alert: PC version readers have been informing me about a glitch
associated with pulling the block out from the bottom of the gate at this part.
Once the block has been pulled out then the switch will not function.  Read
below for another way to approach this portion without pushing the block
underneath the door.

Another way to perform this part is to push the block over to the closed gate,
just below the high walkway, then pull the switch, get on the block, jump to
the ledge on the door while it opens, then quickly jump to grab onto the high
walkway.

-- Checkpoint

Step on the *PRESSURE PLATE* in front of the door to open it then walk through
the doorway.  Surprisingly the door will remain open as Lara continues ahead.
Run past the tiled floor in between the pillars and walk through the doorway
ahead.  Lara will look up at a collection of blades on a chandelier attached to
the ceiling of the next room.  A sudden rattling will distract her attention as
if something big is about to happen.  The key for this room lies on the center
circular floor up ahead in plain view under the chandelier with blades.  Walk
up to the circular floor and take the --KEY OF DAMOCLES-- then quickly run away
from the circular floor as the bladed chandelier falls.  The entrance to this
area will seal off, blades will rise from the tiles in between the pillars in
the next room, and swords will be showcased as the camera pans over the ceiling
of the outside room.

-- Checkpoint

Well, damn.  Go ahead and pick up the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from the floor
of the current room if it hasn't been collected already.  Grab the ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ to the side of the pillar to the right as well.  Run up the crumbled
walkway forming a ramp in the back of the current room then jump and grapple to
the *RING* on the wall above.  Pull up while on the grapple then jump to the
platform on the left side.

Hop over to the middle walkway above the fallen chandelier then hop over the
destroyed section of walkway on the right side and jump to the alcove on the
right.  Pull the *SWITCH* in the alcove to make some blade on a red tile in the
next room retract - this will allow Lara to reach a switch in the next room as
well as provide an easy path where she doesn't have to endanger herself as
much.  Don't even bother about jumping along the *LEDGES* on the wall to the
left in the hope of reaching the artifact on that side since the blades will
not allow Lara to pull up into them.

-- Checkpoint

Walk through the doorway into the previous room and a giant sword will drop
from the ceiling above as Lara starts to enter the room.  Walk to the right
then pay attention to the way the first set of nine tiles on the left rise and
retract. They have a pattern to where one of the tiles will remain safe for a
few seconds longer than the others that retract.

X = will not retract
x = will retract but quickly rise again
o = will retract for the longest

                        exit
                         ^
                         |
X X X    X X X   X X X   x x X
X X o    X x x   o X X   x X X
X X x    X o X   x x X   X X X

Be sure to hold the walk (R2) button while moving along the other side since
giant swords will drop from the ceiling as Lara passes nearby them.  Run to the
opposite side of the room (Lara's left) and move past the red tile where the
blades retracted from earlier (after pulling the switch on other side).

================================= EXTRA INFO ==================================

Here is the pattern of the other set of tiles just for fun (total of 16 tiles):

(These are setup while facing the 16 tiles and standing on the white tile at
the right end on the side with the falling swords on the ceiling)

X x X X   x X X X   X o X X   X x x X   X X X x
X x X X   o X X X   x x X X   X X o X   X X x x -> exit
X o X X   x x X X   X x X X   X X X X   X X X X

================================= EXTRA INFO ==================================

Stand on the broken pillar then jump to the *LEDGE* on the side wall.  Leap up
to the *LEDGE* above the current one and shimmy to the left then pull up to the
alcove above with the *SWITCH* then pull the switch to make the blades on the
alcove past the bars retract into the tiles - this will also make the blades of
a white tile below retract as well and will save Lara from having to move
through the first set of blades when she returns.

-- Checkpoint

|                              ARTIFACT (6/6)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Hang off of the alcove and drop below.  Stand on the piece of pillar and    |
| jump over the blades on the red tiles in order to land in front of the      |
| doorway of the room with the blade chandelier.  Enter the room and run up   |
| the back the ramp, grapple to the ring, wall run to the right platform,     |
| jump across to the left portion of the walkway then leap over to the left   |
| alcove and retrieve the --ARTIFACT (6/6)-- from the alcove.                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Run and climb all the way back to the alcove with the switch that was pulled to
make the blades retract in order to get the artifact in the previous room with
the tiles of blades.  There is no need to go through the first set of rising
and retracting blades if Lara pulled the switch from earlier.

-- Checkpoint

Grab the white *COLUMN* on the left side of the alcove then jump to the tall
pillar across from the column and pull up onto it.  Hop over to the next pillar
then jump to the white *COLUMN* on the right side of the alcove against the
right wall.  Collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from the alcove then jump toward
the set of *LEDGES* on the wall beside the alcove and climb to the top one then
shimmy to the left.

-- Checkpoint (BE SURE to activate the checkpoint by walking into the right
               corner near the column - sometimes it will not activate though.)

Jump to the left then grapple the *RING* on the wall up above to make Lara wall
run.  This next jump is very tricky since it requires Lara to jump off the wall
and land on the pillar behind her.  In order to perform this jump, Lara must
jump (press toward the pillar [to the left] then tap the Jump button) right
before she turns to run back to the right.  If the jump is not performed
precisely then Lara will jump straight ahead and fall to the floor below.

(If Lara falls below then just kill her by jumping into a set of blades to
restart at the checkpoint above (if it was activated) or just save at the last
checkpoint and reload)

From the pillar that Lara lands on, jump to the next three pillars across from
the current one then and grab the small *LEDGE* on the wall to the side of the
last pillar.  Jump to the right and grab the *LEDGE* on the side wall then move
to the right and hop over to the piece of *LEDGE* on the right and shimmy
around the corner to the right then jump into the alcove.  Push the *CRANK*
counterclockwise to open the door below then quickly fall to the bottom and run
under the door before it closes.  Keep in mind that you have to push these
particular cranks in a circular motion, pressing toward whichever direction is
in front of Lara while she pushes it.

Follow the corridor to the gate then pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall.  Run
over to the gate and grab onto the *LEDGE* in the center of it.  After four
beats from the timer, jump to grab the opening up above the gate and pull up
then move through the opening and fall to the other side of the gate.  Continue
through the tunnel ahead.

-- Checkpoint

The usual platform will move out of the wall below the entrance.  Fall off the
platform to reach the bottom floor once again then rush over to the emblems on
the wall surrounding the gate at the bottom.  Place each of the keys into the
emblem with the matching color in order to remove all the blades that hold the
gate in place.

From left to right:

Blue = Poseidon  -  Purple = Hephaestus  -  Red = Damocles  -  Green = Atlas

Using the final key will end the level!

This level starts right where the other left off so enter the doorway that Lara
unlocked with the keys and proceed through the tunnel.  Turn left and follow
the corridor to the end then turn right.  Rats will attack as Lara enters the
room at the end of the corridor.

-- Checkpoint

Move up the slanted piece of wall debris to the left and jump to the *LEDGE* of
the platform in front of it then pull up.  Leap and grab onto the *LEDGE* of
the next platform to the right and pull up then jump and grab the *LEDGE* of
the overhead walkway.

Pull and shoot the rat at the top.  Walk to the opposite end of the walkway and
fall to the platform below it.  Fall down the small walkway in front of the
pool then leap over the pool and grab onto the *LEDGE* of the platform on the
other side then climb up to the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ on the broken walkway ahead.

Dive into the pool and swim through the tunnel with the fallen debris leaning
against the wall.  At the intersection, turn left and swim down the tunnel with
another piece of debris blocking the way.  Turn to the right and swim through
the middle of the broken wall ahead then quickly surface in the next area.

-- Checkpoint

SLAVE QUARTERS

Pull up and kill the rats and bats moving about on the floor above.  Lara will
pull up into an area with several cages full of skeletons.  Jump on top of the
small cage to the side then hop up and grab the *LEDGE* above it.  Jump to the
*LEDGES* to the right and hop across them to reach the top of the large cage on
the side of the room.  Grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ at the top of the large cage
and drop back down.

Climb back on top of the small cage then leap to the ledge again only this time
shimmy to the left and grab the *LEDGE* over the pool that Lara just pulled up
from to enter this area.  Move to the left across the ledge then jump to grab
the next *LEDGE* to Lara's back on the other side.  Leap to the *COLUMN* across
from the ledge then jump on top of the large cage nearby.  Walk to the left end
of the cage and jump over the wooden wall that separates the two side of this
room - the jump has to performed at the end of corner or Lara will not jump
high enough to make it.  Fall to the other side then run up the dirt trail
through the corridor in the middle of the back wall.

-- Checkpoint

ARENA

A cutscene will trigger once Lara enters the arena ahead.  The door will seal
off behind Lara and she will be attacked by two gorillas.  Fire at them from a
distance and use the dodge button (O) to avoid their attacks when they get up
close.  The slow motion dive after their rage attack will be the best way to
kill them quickly.  Switch to the shotgun if the need arises.

Walk over to the back right portion of the arena after the battle and collect
the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Find the slanted piece of wall debris on the left side
of the arena and move up it then jump to the *LEDGE* below the sitting area and
pull up.  Step up to the walkway.  Pierre will shout from some unknown location
to taunt Lara at this time.

CLIMBING TO THE BALCONY

Move all the way to the right of the walkway of the seating area then step up
on the wall to the right of the walkway to find some more ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.
Turn around and run to the top of the middle walkway that is in between the
seats.  Two bats will attack and the camera will shift to the left to show a
pillar with some crevices on it.

Stand on the top portion then jump to grab the lowest *CREVICE* and shimmy to
the left then hop up to the next *CREVICE* and move to the left some more.
Jump to the flat rock across from the second crevice then leap across to the
flat rock platform across from the current one.  Collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++
from the left side then slide down the *RAMP* ahead.

Stand on the piece of wall debris up ahead then slide down the *RAMP* beside it
and jump to the next piece of wall debris across from the ramp while sliding.
Turn to the right and jump toward the *LEDGE* of the balcony walkway on the
building to the side then pull up.  Run through the corridor to the right.
Lara will come upon a gate that requires a key.  Walk over to the *LEVER*
through the left entrance and pull it to open a door down below in the arena.

-- Checkpoint

Exit this area by jumping to the seating area on the right side - walk further
down the hall then jump to the ramp of the seating area.  Two bats will attack
from behind.  Fall to the arena below and two gorillas followed by two lions
will race through the door that was recently open.  Use the shotgun of run over
to the ramp and jump up to the seating area then shoot them from above.

-- Checkpoint

SLAVE QUARTERS 2

Walk through the door where the enemies came from and move down the corridor.
An item will be visible on top of large key to the left as Lara makes her way
into the room at the bottom.  Move to the other side and collect the ++SHOTGUN
AMMO++ from the right corner then hop over the ramp to the left.

Stand on top of the small cage near the opposite wall then look toward the
large cage to the side to find a movable metal *CAGE* up above it.  While
facing it, throw out Lara's grapple to latch onto it then pull it off the cage.
Push the *CAGE* all the way over to the ramp where Lara just came from it then
push it up the ramp and push it over to the other side.  Fall to the other side
and drag the *CAGE* all the way over to the large cage against the right wall
with the item on top.  Position the *CAGE* below the larger cage then hop up
and retrieve the --BALCONY KEY-- from the top.

-- Checkpoint

RETURNING TO THE BALCONY

Run back into the arena above and fight off the pair of lions that await Lara's
return.

-- Checkpoint

Climb all the way back to the Balcony Gate as Lara did before starting with the
ramp to the side, move around the pillar crevices, over the rock platforms,
then over to the balcony walkway.  Use the Balcony Key on the keyhole to the
side of the gate to lift the gate.  Walk through the newly opened doorway then
scale the *LADDER* to the left.

-- Checkpoint

ABOVE THE COLISEUM

Lara is now on the rooftop of the balcony.  If the bats on the right side of
the seating area weren't activated before fighting the two gorillas and the two
lions then walk over to the right side of the rooftop and kill the two bats to
put them out of their misery.

Run over to the left side of the Balcony rooftop then jump and grab the *LEDGE*
of the collapsed wall across from the rooftop and pull up.  Notice the ring on
the ceiling up ahead - move over to that side.  Lara can hang off the edge of
this side and retrieve a ++SMALL MEDPACK++ on rock platform below but she will
have to do a bit of backtracking to get back to this point since she cannot
grapple the ring above from the platform below.

Jump and grapple to the ceiling *RING* (make sure to face it while jumping)
then pull up a bit while on the grapple.  There is another ring below the
platform ahead but Lara needs to get on top of that platform so swing and jump
over to land on it.

Notice the platform up ahead with the small medipack on it.  Find the small
ledge below that platform - it is to the left and it slants a bit along with
the wall.  Jump to that *LEDGE* then hop up on the platform and collect the
++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  Turn around and jump to grab the *CREVICE* on the pillar
to the right.  Shimmy to the left while on the pillar then jump and grab onto
the top portion of the hidden ledge to the left. Grab the ++DUAL 50 CALIBER
PISTOLS++ from this hidden area.

Hang off the side of this ledge then move across the *LEDGE* to the left and
pull back up to the platform that Lara was previously on.  Jump back toward the
*RING* on the ceiling and grapple it once again.  Turn around while on the
grapple then lower Lara a bit while facing the ring below the platform that she
was just one.  Swing over toward the *RING* then jump and grapple it.

|=============================================================================|
| Turn toward the shiny object in the small alcove to the left up ahead.      |
| Make sure to move down far enough to where Lara is almost hitting the       |
| alcove with her swings then jump to the portion of the *LEDGE* below the    |
| alcove to the right.  Lara must jump toward the right since there is a      |
| curved structure right above the alcove that will mess up her grabbing if   |
| she jumps directly toward the alcove.  Collect the --ARTIFACT (1/1)-- from  |
| the alcove then hang off the *LEDGE* below it once again.                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Move to the right while on the ledge then jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the very
small flat portion above the ramp ahead.  Slide down the *RAMP* then quickly
hop over to the flat rock across from it.  Jump to grab the *CREVICE* on the
pillar to the right then shimmy to the left and grab the *LEDGE* at the top of
the pillar then shimmy to the left some more.  Leap over to the flat top of the
pillar across from Lara then jump to the rooftop of the building with the two
statues up ahead.

Move to the other side of the rooftop then jump to the flat rock below and turn
around.  Leap over toward the border surrounding the building and grab the ++50
CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from the walkway inside.

-- Checkpoint

Run down the corridor ahead.  Take left path when they split (the other is
blocked off) and move down the set of stairs.  Blast the two bats at the end
then keep moving and the level will end once Midas' Palace is reached.

Lara will start at the steps leading into Midas' Palace.  Run up the steps and
enter the room with the statue up ahead.  Three gorillas will attack Lara from
different portions of the room as the statue room is entered.  Run directly
into the room so they do not surround Lara then shoot them from afar.  It is
possible to jump onto the platform with the statue of Midas and shoot them from
there without worrying about getting hit.

Notice that the statue of Midas has four block-shaped openings along the sides
of the front portion.  The top right opening already has a gold block inside.
Lara must find a gold block to fit into each one of the openings.  Don't jump
into Midas' fallen hand, or Lara will turn into a 24K Lara statue and die.
This death is traditional however to a Tomb Raider player on their first time
through so feel free to find a checkpoint and watch the death animation.

Face the entrance and walk over to the fountain on that side.  Stand on the
piece of wall debris then climb up onto the fountain.  Jump to grab the
*CREVICE* on the wall to the right of the fountain then jump and grab the next
*CREVICE*.  Move to the left and pull up to the walkway up above.  Grab the
++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from the right corner then pull the *SWITCH* past the water.
The left gate below will open.

-- Checkpoint

Climb back down the crevices and enter the newly opened gate.  Run up all the
sets of stairs and enter the room to the left at the end of the twisting
corridors.

-- Checkpoint

SPIKED ROOM WITH PLATFORMS

Lara will enter a room with several platforms and ramps along with pointed
spikes lying around.  Don't move into any of the spikes or they will harm Lara.
Turn to the left upon entering the room and grapple the *RING* on the white
wall up above.  Tug on the grapple to yank the blocks out of the wall and
reveal a hidden alcove.

Turn back around and grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ near a platform on the right
side of the room then Walk through the doorway on the opposite side and grab
the *CRATE* along the side of the stairs.  Drag the *CRATE* out into the room
with platforms and spikes.  Place it next to the closest ramp outside the room.

Back through the doorway, pull the *SWITCH* in the alcove that the crate was
blocking.  The switch will open the gate up the stairs to the side.  Run up the
first set of stairs and grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ along the wall to the right
then continue up the next set of stairs.  At the top, pull the *LEVER* to raise
the platforms in the room below.

All the platforms without the spikes on top are timed and there will be a sound
of three beats each time that Lara land on one.  Once the third beat has
sounded the platform will lower back into the ground.  The spiked platforms are
not timed.  Lara must jump and grab onto the side of each of the spiked
platforms in order to make use of them in jumping to the other platforms.

Jump to the first tall platform then turn to the left and jump to grab onto the
*LEDGE* along the side of the spike platform.  Shimmy around the corner to the
right or left of the spike platform then jump to the ramp next to the spike
platform.  Slide down the ramp then quickly jump to the walkway that is
sticking out of the wall and pull up as Lara grabs on.  Face to the right then
quickly jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* of the spike platform across from the
walkway.  Hop up to the top *LEDGE* on the spike platform and shimmy around to
the opposite side then jump to the platform across from it.  Quickly jump to
the ramp up ahead after landing.  Slide down the ramp and jump to the walkway
that is sticking out of the wall and pull up as Lara grabs on. (a) Jump to the
next walkway on the left then jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the spiked platform
across from the walkway (to the left).  Shimmy to the opposite side by moving
around the left side (the right is broken) of the spiked platform then jump
across to the lower *LEDGE* of the tall platform across from the current one.
Jump to grab onto the top *LEDGE* then quickly pull up. (b) Jump to the alcove
on the right side.  Collect the --LEAD BAR-- from the pedestal inside the
alcove.

|=============================================================================|
| In order to retrieve the relic, Lara must push a corner of the movable      |
| *CRATE*, on the first floor, under the destroyed side of the ramp platform  |
| that is in front of the alcove with the relic.  The crate will keep the     |
| ramp platform from moving back into the ground since the platform will      |
| start to retract once Lara is halfway across.  Looking across at the alcove |
| directly in front of the lever, it is in the back left portion of the room. |
| The crate will eventually be pushed out of the destroyed side after about   |
| five minutes worth of preventing it from lowering.                          |

| (b) Jump toward the ramp platform directly ahead and jump to grab onto the  |
| *LEDGE* of the alcove against the wall that it leans toward.  Shimmy to the |
| right on the ledge then pull up and walk around the wall debris to find the |
| --ATHENIAN OWL FIGURINE RELIC--.  Drop from the alcove back to the floor    |
| below.                                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

-- Checkpoint

Leave this area once the Lead Bar is collected and return to the Midas statue
room.  Once Lara comes to the entrance of the statue room two gorillas will
attack.

Find the *CREVICES* on the left side of throne that Midas is sitting in and use
them to get to the top of the statue.  Hop up to the walkway above and walk
around the back side of the throne then pull the *SWITCH* to open the next door
below.  Jump on top of the back of the throne and grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ on
top.  Fall back down the statue of Midas then enter through the next doorway on
the left side.

-- Checkpoint

PILLAR ROOM

While moving through the corridor ahead debris will fall from the ceiling to
show that the area is not entirely stable.  The camera will zoom in to show the
next Lead Bar in an opening inside of a pillar beyond a fence up ahead.

-- Checkpoint

There is a stairway to the right, but enter the room up ahead for now.  The
stairway will only lead to a walkway where nothing can be accomplished at the
moment.  The lead bar is unreachable for the moment, so find the doorway on the
back left and follow the corridor past it.  At the bottom of the stairs a
gorilla will rush toward Lara and attack followed by a lion.  Blast them both
then enter the room that they come from.  Grapple each of the three *RINGS*
connected to the boards that support the broken pillar in the middle of the
room to yank them down and cause the pillar to sink.  The --LEAD BAR-- on the
pillar above will fall onto the platform that is holding the pillar so rush
over to it and grab it.  Exit the room and travel back to the top floor.

Lara's actions down below have caused a landslide on the top floor.  Run past
the pillar debris along the walkway and enter the corridor on other side.  Move
up the stairway on the left wall that Lara previously passed.  Collect the
++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the near the left wall then walk out onto the walkway on
the right side.

-- Checkpoint

Three bats will attack as Lara steps to the outside.  Turn to the right and
jump to the platform along the sand wall then move up the next few platforms
and jump to grab the small piece of *LEDGE* at the top.  Jump to the *LEDGE* on
the left and pull up then collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Hang off the ledge
and jump back to the right.

Grab back onto the piece of *LEDGE* at the top again and jump to the right this
time to grab the *LEDGE* on the right wall.  Shimmy to the right and look up to
spot a ring on the wall above.  Jump and grapple the *RING* then wall run and
leap over to the *LEDGE* on the wall across from Lara.  Hop over to the next
*LEDGE* on the right.  Follow the ledge to the right then jump to the *ROPE*
behind Lara.

Turn to the left while on the rope and line up with the *CREVICE* along the
side of the pillar embedded in the wall then swing over to it.  Use the
overhead set of *CREVICES* to jump to the top crevice (third) then jump across
to the *LEDGE* of the flat wall debris above once the camera angle turns.

-- Checkpoint

Turn around and spot the white pillar with the sloped top forming a *RAMP*
below.  Make a diagonal jump off of the current platform so that Lara lands on
the ramp then quickly jump to the flat pillar debris on the sand wall in front
of the sloped pillar.  A normal jump off of the ramp will make Lara
automatically jump toward the pillar debris.

Turn around and jump then grab the *CREVICE* along the side of the sloped
pillar that Lara just jumped from. Shimmy to the right then hop over to the
platform across from the right side of the crevice.  Walk over to the wall and
jump up the *LEDGES* on the wall then hop over to the lower *LEDGE* on the
right.  Jump up to the next *LEDGE* then pull up to the small walkway above.
Look against the far wall to see a small medipack in an alcove.  In order to
get the item, Lara must wall run then jump off the wall and leap over to the
flat piece of wall debris on the sand wall below it.  Turn to the right then
jump and grapple the *RING* up above then wall run and leap over to the flat
piece of wall debris across from the wall - press to the right and Jump at the
very end of the wall run.  Leap and climb up to the alcove on the left and
collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.

Jump back to the wall debris on the sand wall then look off toward the walkway
below the gold ring that Lara grappled earlier - that walkway is the next
destination. If Lara jumps directly to that walkway from the current area then
will loose a bit of health so jump toward the sand wall ramp above the walkway
then slide down to it.

Follow the corridor through the doorway all the way to the end.  Once Lara
reaches the final turn, two gorillas will run toward her and attack so keep the
guns ready.  Lara will emerge on a walkway back in the Midas statue room.  This
walkway is across from the switch that opened the door to the left of the Midas
statue.  Approach the *SWITCH* on the wall to the left and pull it to make the
final door in the back of the Midas statue open.

-- Checkpoint

Jump into the pool in the middle of the room in order to get down safely.
Climb up the left side of the Midas statue via the crevices then enter the
corridor behind the newly opened doorway.

-- Checkpoint

Follow the corridor all the way to the end.  Lara will emerge in a room with a
large pool in the middle.

-- Checkpoint

As Lara steps on top of the *PRESSURE PLATE* on the middle walkway, a cutscene
will trigger where flames will start to spew from the circular platforms around
the area.  The pool is not exactly safe either.  There is a crocodile in the
water, but he will only show himself when Lara jumps into the water.  Lara can
pull up from the pool on either the right or left stairway.  Jump into the pool
below to lure the crocodile then swim over to one of the stairways and pull up
then kill him from above with the handguns.

REACHING THE RIGHT ALCOVE

Jump back into the water to the opposite side of the large circular platform on
the right then dive beneath it and find the *LEVER* on the bottom side then
pull it to make a pillar lift into the air of the circular platform up above.
Return to the walkway with the pressure plate.

Lara must reach the alcove on the right side across from the right circular
platform, so start by jumping to the small circular platform ahead.  Lara will
most likely grab onto the side.  Pull up and the flame will not her unless she
moves closer to it.  Wait for the flame to go out then quickly run and jump to
the *LEDGE* of the platform to the right.  Each of the four sides has a ledge
on it.  Flames move around this pillar in a circle, but Lara can outrun them
and stay in between them and long as she pull up in between them and keeps
running.

Pull up as one of the flames move by then run over to the right and look on the
middle pillar to see a *CREVICE*.  Jump to the crevice then quickly jump and
grab onto the next *CREVICE* above since the flames can hit Lara from the
bottom crevice.  Jump to top overhead *CREVICE* then move around to the left
side and jump to one of the *LEDGES* surrounding the ladder on the walkway of
the alcove across from the pillar.  Pull up and flip the *SWITCH* on the back
wall.  Pulling this switch will cause another circular platform to rise out of
the water in the middle of the pool.

-- Checkpoint

REACHING THE LEFT ALCOVE

Jump back to the *CREVICE* on the alcove that Lara just hopped off of.  Drop
down the ledges when there is a break in the flames then hop over to the small
circular platform that rose out of the water earlier in between the current
large platform and another large platform with lion heads on the other side.
Wait for the flame to go out then run and jump over to the *CREVICE* below the
group of lion heads on the side of the next large pillar.  Shimmy to the left
then line Lara's backside up with the top of the square pillar in the water
then leap over to the top of it.  Jump and grab onto the *LADDER* on the side
wall then climb to the alcove overhead.  Pull the *SWITCH* in the back to raise
the pillar with lion heads on the circular platform to the left of the closest
platform.

-- Checkpoint

REACHING THE MIDDLE ALCOVE

Walk back to the front of the alcove then grapple the small pillars on the side
of the larger pillar with lion heads and tug on it to rotate the small pillars
and reveal some metal *LEDGES* along the side of the circular pillar with lion
heads. The metal ledges are very hard to see, so just jump over to the circular
pillar and Lara will grab onto one of the *LEDGES* above the crevice.  Jump up
the ledges and climb to the top of the circular pillar.

Jump to the side of the large circular platform to the left.  Hang off the one
of the four *LEDGES* around the side if the flames move too close for comfort.
Grab the first *CREVICE* on the side of the pillar then quickly hop up to the
next overhead *CREVICE*.  Wait for the fire of the right lion head to go out
then shimmy to the right.  Do the same for the next then jump to grab the next
overhead *CREVICE* as the fire goes out above then quickly shimmy to the safe
space on the right.  When the camera turns to the show the alcove behind Lara,
jump to the alcove.  Collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from behind the furthest
pillar to the right then grab the --LEAD BAR-- from the pedestal near the back
wall.

|=============================================================================|
| In order to get this relic, Lara will have to race back through the whole   |
| obstacle course again.  Start out by returning to the walkway with the      |
| *PRESSURE SWITCH* then return to the large circular platform on the right   |
| side (jump past the small circular platform).  Hop back up the *CREVICES*   |
| on the side of the pillar then get back on top of the right alcove.         |
|                                                                             |
| While facing away from the switch, walk to the right end of the alcove and  |
| look on the right wall up above to spot a gold *RING*.  Jump and grapple to |
| the ring then wall run and jump to the small *LEDGE* below the wall ahead.  |
| Drop to the *RAMP* above the ledge then quickly jump to the small *LEDGE*   |
| on the wall ahead.  Jump to the right *LEDGE* then hop up to the overhead   |
| *CREVICE*.  Leap over to the *RAMP* across from the crevice.  As soon as    |
| Lara hits the ramp, jump directly to the *POLE* up above the ramp.  Swing   |
| and jump to the next *POLE* then jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in the      |
| water.  Turn to the right and jump to the *LEDGE* on the side wall then     |
| leap to the left to land on the *RAMP* below and quickly jump to the hidden |
| alcove behind the large circular pillar.                                    |
|                                                                             |
| Pulling the switch will cause the pillar on the large circular platform     |
| above to raise enough to reveal a hidden alcove with the relic inside.  The |
| pillar is timed, so Lara has to jump through all the dangerous traps above  |
| and make it to the relic before the pillar lowers again.  If she doesn't    |
| make it in time then return to this alcove and flip the switch once again   |
| to make the pillar rise.                                                    |
|                                                                             |

| (MAKE SURE to save the game once the checkpoint activates after pulling the |
| switch to save that checkpoint.  This will start Lara right next to the     |
| switch if she fails. Simply pull it again to initiate the rising pillar.    |

|                                                                             |
| To get there quickly, jump into the water and swim all the way back to the  |
| middle walkway with the pressure plate.  Jump across the small circular     |
| platform then jump over to the large circular platform on the left.  Jump   |
| over to the next small circular platform then leap to the *CREVICE* of the  |
| large pillar with the lion heads.  Move to the left and keep moving even    |
| after the camera shows the platform behind Lara then hop up all the         |
| *LEDGES* above and climb to the top then turn to the left and leap over to  |
| the circular walkway of the platform across from the current one and run    |
| around the left corner.  Quickly grab the --GRIFFIN-HEAD PROTOME RELIC--    |
| from the hidden alcove before the pillar sinks again.  Don't worry about    |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Return to the room with the statue of Midas.  Two gorillas will attack Lara on
the way back right before she reaches the Midas room.  Fall down the statue of
Midas and approach his fallen hand on the right side.  Press the /\ to interact
with his hand and select each of three lead bars in order to turn them into
gold bars.  Place the three gold bars in the square shaped indentions along the
sides of the statue to open the gate in the middle pool in front of the statue.
The lever will end as Lara places the final gold bar.

Dive into the pool in front of the statue of Midas and swim through the tunnel
that leads downward.  Facing the statue of Midas while diving, take the tunnel
straight ahead once Lara reaches the bottom.  Follow the tunnel until Lara
comes to a split.  The right path will allow Lara to swim up to an air pocket
to get some air - look for the sunlight then start to swim upward at that point
to finally be able to surface.  The left path will lead to the next area.

-- Checkpoint

Surface to the top at the end of the left path and grab the wooden *CRATE*
blocking the tunnel along the wall.  Push it through the tunnel then shoot the
rat in the room behind the crate.  Push the *CRATE* under the *SWITCH* on the
left wall then pull the switch to the wooden trapdoor across from the switch.

Hang off the side of the trapdoor then fall to the area below.  Draw Lara's
guns then blast the rats.  Walk through the doorway into the next area.

-- Checkpoint

THE CISTERN - FINDING THE FIRST CRATE

Pierre will speak from some unknown area as Lara enters the Cistern.  He will
comment that the water is quite refreshing.  No, no it isn't - in fact there
are two crocodiles in the water below but Lara will deal with that later.  Turn
to the right and notice the pole to the side.  Jump and grab onto the *POLE*
then swing toward the *RING* up on the wall ahead and grapple to it to wall
run.  Jump to the other side and grab the *CREVICE* on the side of the wall
(Lara will turn in midair to grab it).  Shimmy to the left then jump across to
the *LEDGE* across from Lara then drop.  Fall down to the shiny object and
collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++.

Jump to grab the *CREVICE* in the wall ahead then jump to the right to land on
a *CREVICE* along the side of the piece of walkway to the right.  Jump upward
again and pull up to the piece of walkway above.  Grab the ++MINI SMG AMMO++
from the right side of the walkway.  Leap back over to the crevice that Lara
previously grabbed while wall running and jump to the ledge across from that
crevice after moving to the left.  Shimmy to the left on the ledge and don't
let go this time.  Jump and grapple onto the *RING* on the top portion of the
left wall to perform another wall run.  Leap over to the walkway at the other
end of the Cistern.

Hop over the gap in the walkway and follow it to the middle.  The room in the
center with the heads spewing water is the main destination for the first part
of this level but Lara will need a platform to stand on in order to reach it.
Jump across the next two gaps in the walkway and continue to the opposite side
of the walkway.  Grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the other side and find the
pole on the wall.

Jump to grab the *POLE* then swing to the next *POLE* and finally the next
walkway up ahead.  Grab the wooden *CRATE* on the side of the walkway and push
it off the side.

-- Checkpoint

FINDING THE SECOND CRATE

Find the *CREVICES* along the wall then jump and grab the highest one Lara can
reach then jump up to the overhead *CREVICE*.  Shimmy to the left then jump and
grab the *POLE* and swing across to the next walkway.

There is another pole on the other side, but Lara cannot make this jump from
the walkway, so find the *CREVICE* on the wall to the right then jump to grab
it and shimmy to the left then jump to the *POLE*.  Swing and jump to the next
*POLE* then hop over to the *LEDGE* on the wall ahead.  Shimmy over to the left
then jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the other side of the alcove and continue to
the around the corner to the left.  Pull up to the walkway with another wooden
*CRATE* then push it off the side.

Jump to the other side of the walkway across from where Lara pushed the second
crate down to the bottom floor - please note that Lara can only make this jump
from the current side of the walkway and not the other side.  Go ahead and hop
across to the next piece of walkway and look to the right.  The *CRANK* in the
alcove to the right will allow Lara to raise and lower the water below.

SETTING UP THE CRATES BELOW

To get down quickly, jump into the pool in the middle then quickly climb out.
Swim in the same direction that the crank was on the top floor in order to pull
up and exit the pool.  There are two crocodiles in the water, so find them and
shoot them.  Lara may need to jump in and out to get their attention.  She can
still actually hit them when the targeting marker is gray so keep firing even
then.

Grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the right side of this area.  One of the
*CRATES* that Lara pushed from above is nearby, so go ahead and push it into
the pool.  Find the fallen piece of walkway on the other side of this area and
run up the walkway debris then jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the left and pull up
then fall to the other side with the crank.  Walk over to the *CRANK* and turn
it clockwise to drain the pool in the middle.

-- Checkpoint

Walk behind the fallen walkway debris ahead to find a ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Fall
off the side of the dam that leads to the middle pool then rush to the other
side and grab the *LEDGE* of the floor above then pull up.  A crocodile will be
up above so stand on the raised portion of the floor and fire at him to kill
him easily.  Walk toward the other side and Lara will come across the first
*CRATE* that she pushed from the floor above.  Push this crate into the drained
pool.  Both crates should now in the drained pool!

Return to the other side with the crank and fall down the platform along the
wall that move downward (like stairs) then fall off the bottom long platform.
Position both of the *CRATES* in the drained pool on top of the two *PRESSURE
PLATES* on the floor.  One of them will open a gate on the floor that contains
a wooden *CRATE W/RING++ while the other will open the floodgate that blocks
the dam area.

LEAVING THE DRAINED POOL

Find the sloped piece of debris leaning against the wall then walk over to it.
Retrieve the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ hidden in the corner right by it.  Step up the
first few pieces of debris then jump to the *RAMP* that they lead up to and
quickly jump then grapple to the *RING* on the wall above to wall run.  Wall
run and jump over to the flat portion of the debris on the other side.  Hop up
to the *CREVICE* to the left then shimmy to the left and jump up to the next
*CREVICE*.

Leap over to the *POLE* across from the crevice then swing and jump to the next
*CREVICE.  Shimmy around the corner to the left and jump to grab the next
*POLE* then swing and jump to the next *CREVICE*.  Shimmy around the corner to
the left once again and climb onto the flat piece of debris that it leads to.
Slide down the *RAMP* on the side of the debris then quickly jump to grab onto
the walkway across from the ramp.  Jump up the next few platforms to exit the
pool.  Flood the pool once again by turning the *CRANK* counterclockwise.

-- Checkpoint

POSITIONING THE FLOATING CRATE

The wooden crate with the ring will rise to top of the pool as it fills again.
Facing the pool, run over to the right dam area and grapple the wooden *CRATE
W/RING* and drag it as far into one of the channels as possible.  Lara may have
to step up onto the sides of the dam area in order to grapple it the first
time.  Once the wooden crate is up against the side of either of the channels
move back over to the area where Lara can pull up from the middle pool - swim
over to it.

GETTING BACK TO THE TOP FLOOR

Look around the area and find the sloped piece of walkway debris that leans
against the side of the pillar of the walkway above - the pillar has two
*CREVICES* along the side.  Run up the piece of debris then jump up the two
*CREVICES*.  Shimmy to the left on the top crevice then jump to grab the *POLE*
up above.  Find the platform to the side of the pole then swing and jump to
catch onto the *LEDGE* on the side of it then pull up.  Climb up the wall
platforms inside the cracked wall.  Face away from the wall and jump to the
bottom small *LEDGE* along the side of the pillar that Lara used to get up to
the pole.  Pull up then jump and grab the *CREVICE* and shimmy around the
corner to the left.  Jump to grab the next *LEDGE* up above then pull up to the
broken portion of the walkway above.

POSITIONING THE FLOATING CRATE AGAIN

Rote the *CRANK* off to the right counterclockwise to raise the water level
once again.

-- Checkpoint

Jump into the water and dive down then swim over to the big pipe that is to the
right of the crank then swim through the small opening in the gate blocking the
pipe.  Collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from inside then quickly swim back
through the opening and surface.  Swim to the area directly in front of the
crank and find the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ in the big pipe on the far wall (dive
down).  There is also a ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ in a smaller pipe far to the left of
the shotgun ammo pipe.

|=============================================================================|
| Swim over to the walkway where the floating crate should be at now and dive |
| down then look at the back of the pillar that is below the big walkway -    |
| the portion that extends out into the water the most - to find a            |
| hard-to-see *LEVER* on the pillar.  The lever is about in the middle of the |
| pillar.  Pull the lever to open the gate in the middle of the pool (where   |
| the two crates are positioned) and reveal an --ARTIFACT (1/2)-- and some    |
| ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++.  Dive down toward the middle and grab them.     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Swim over to the floating crate and climb up on top of it.  Jump to the *LEDGE*
of the high walkway above if it is possible to reach from the crates current
position.  If it isn't then get on one of the sides of the walkway and grapple
the *CRATE W/RING* then pull it closer to the side of the walkway and try
again.  Walk into the room with the three faces spewing water.

-- Checkpoint

Dive into the pool below the faces and swim through the opening at the bottom
and allow the current to carry Lara through the tunnel at the bottom.  It will
shoot her out into a cave.

-- Checkpoint

Pull up onto the visible ground ahead then grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Dive
down into the water and find the tunnel to the right then swim through it and
follow it all the way to the next area then surface.  Facing away from the
water that deposited Lara in the cave, the tunnel near the bottom is to the
right.

Lara will emerge outside the Tomb of Tihocan.  Swim to the left and pull up
onto the dry ground then grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and the ++SHOTGUN
AMMO++.  Facing the front of the tomb, dive down into the water then swim to
the left and keep diving to find a tunnel.  Swim into the tunnel and surface at
the very end.  Pull the *SWITCH* on the cave wall inside to open the door to
the tomb up above then swim back to the surface.

Once everything is collected, pull up to the dry land in front of the tomb then
enter the Tomb of Tihocan.

-- Checkpoint

Walk toward the Scion piece off to the left for a cutscene once Lara walks in
between the row of stone murals.

Interactive Cutscene: O - /\

===============================================================================
--------------------------> Boss Battle - Centaurs <---------------------------

Lara must fight two Centaurs after the group of cutscenes.  The Centaurs will
run in circles around Lara and throw fireballs at her.  Run to the sides and
roll to avoid the fireballs.  Sometimes Lara must roll in order to dodge a
fireball.

Lock on to one of the Centaurs with the L1 button and fire at him.  When his
rage bar is full the Centaur will perform his stone gaze attack.  When he
begins his stone gaze put up Lara's guns to avoid being turned to stone.  The
actual flashing portion of the move is the stoning part, so make sure that Lara
holsters her weapons before that flash.  If Lara is changed to stone, shake the
left analog from left to right to break out.  One of the Centaurs will race
toward the stoned Lara and try to kick her to shatter her - this is a one hit
kill.

Fire at the Centaurs once again and fill one of their rage bars again.  When
the rage bar is full the second time, one of them will run toward Lara and try
to ram her.  Move to the side at that time while he is targeted (with L1) and,
right when the screen distorts, dodge the move by pressing to either side along
with the dodge (O) button then shoot the Centaur when the targeting markers
align and turn red.  The Centaur will be stunned afterward.  Grapple the *RING*
on stunned Centaur's shield then yank the shield out of his hand by tugging on
it with the /\ button.  Do this for both Centaurs.

Once both of them are without shields shoot them until they perform their stone
gaze then quickly run over to one of the fallen shields and pick it up (/\)
then face one of the Centaurs while holding the shield to change that Centaur
to stone.  Fire at the Centaur while he is stoned to damage him and ultimately
break him.  Keep reflecting their stares back at them and then shoot them while
they are stone to defeat them both.

It is best to stand by a shield as their rage meter is almost full then pick up
the shield quickly when they gaze.  They will only perform their stare move
when their rage meter fills once both shields are gone.  Be sure to drop their
shield (/\ again) if the stone reflection misses.  The handguns are all that is
needed for this battle.

NOTE: I receive a bunch of emails about gamers having trouble grappling the
rings on the Centaurs' shields once they are stunned.  Be sure to stand
directly in front of them while they are stunned and don't be real close to
them and Lara should grapple the shield.  This sounds much like the problem
with the grapple from Tomb Raider Legend where if Lara wasn't facing an object
perfectly then it would not grapple the object.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

A cutscene will play once both Centaurs are defeated and the level will end
afterwards.

Run down the tunnel ahead and hang off the side then drop to the floor past the
broken wall.

-- Checkpoint

Locate the damaged pillar with the *RING* on the right platform above.  Grapple
the ring then pull the pillar down.  Find another damaged pillar on the left
platform then grapple the *RING* on the side and yank it down as well.  The
left pillar will leave a piece of pillar debris as it falls.

-- Checkpoint

Pull the stone *BLOCK* out of the left wall and grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL
AMMO++ and the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the hidden alcove behind it.  Climb on
top of the pillar debris that was left behind from the left pillar then jump to
grab the *LEDGE* of the platform above and pull up.  Collect the ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ then jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the left side of the wall and
shimmy to Lara's left.

Jump and grab the *CREVICE* to the left then hop up the next two *CREVICES*
above.  Shimmy to the left across the top crevice then jump and grab the *POLE*
on the left and swing then jump over to the *RAMP* ahead.  Slide down the ramp
then jump over to the *LEDGE* across from it - this is where the right pillar
once stood.

Move to the left around the corner of the ledge then jump to grab the *POLE*
across from the ledge.  Swing and jump to the next *POLE* then jump to the
*LEDGE* of the walkway across from the pole.  Pull up and grab the *CREVICE* on
the left wall followed by the *CREVICE* above that one.  Move to the right and
jump to the *LEDGE* of the walkway on the right then pull up.

-- Checkpoint

Jump and grab onto the *SCARAB* figure then leap up to the *LEDGE* of the
walkway above before the scarab figure moves downward - these sinking ledges
are frequent in the Egypt level.

Slide down the sand *RAMP* then jump to grab the *POLE* that hangs over the
pit.  Swing on the *POLE* and leap to the *SCARAB* figure then quickly grab the
*LEDGE* of the walkway above then pull up.  Follow the corridor and walk
through the open wall at the end.

-- Checkpoint

A black panther will attack Lara as she slides down the *RAMP* to the floor
below.  These enemies are quite vicious, so be sure to stay at a distance from
them as much as possible.  Walk over to the right side and collect the
++SHOTGUN AMMO++.

Climb on top of the walkway across from the ramp - don't get near the ramp yet!
Turn to the left and grab onto the *LEDGE* on the left wall and shimmy to the
left around the corner.  Jump to the next *LEDGE* then pull up into the narrow
space above - Lara will crouch.  Move to the left and grab the *LEDGE* on the
left wall then shimmy around the left side.  Pull up to the platform that Lara
starts to move across then collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Hang off the side
of the platform then drop to the bottom.

Get back on the walkway ahead and walk toward the ramp of the outside area.  A
cutscene will play once Lara gets near the ramp.  She will fight a group of
mummified jackals after the cutscene.  These enemies shoot fireballs from a
distance and are very aggressive from close range.  Adrenaline kills are still
the best way to defeat them like just about any enemies.

Grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ near the ramp after the fight.  Head to the
right and turn then search behind the pillar to the right of the damaged sphinx
to find a ++SMALL HEALTHPACK++.  All the way across from the ramp that Lara
slid down and to the left of the leftmost pillar grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.
Jump into the middle pool and look in between the left pillar and middle
section to find another ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  The middle pillar surrounded by
the pool requires some items that Lara does not possess at the moment.

Face the sphinx (with the damaged door) and climb on top of the pillar piece to
its left then jump and grab the *LEDGE* of the left pillar and shimmy to the
left.  Hop up to the overhead *LEDGE* then move to the left some more.  Hop
across to the *LEDGE* on the pillar to the left of the current one then leap up
to the next *LEDGE*.  Move to the right and jump to yet another *LEDGE* then
jump and grab onto the top of the walkway above and pull up.

-- Checkpoint

Leap over to the platform to the left and shoot the *BUTTON* on the wall.  A
*POLE* will extend out of the wall up ahead but it is timed, so quickly jump
and swing to the platform on the other side.  Pick up the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL
AMMO++ on the others side.  Leap on top of the pillar to the left then jump to
the top of the next pillar.  From the second pillar turn to the right then make
a diagonal jump to the right *LEDGE* of the walkway below the ladder.  Pull up
then climb the *LADDER*.  Jump to the top of the sphinx's head to the left.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/3)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Walk up inside the alcove behind the top of the sphinx and climb up to the  |
| right corridor up above.  Follow the corridor to the end then grab the      |
| --ARTIFACT (1/3)--.                                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Look to the side of the sphinx's head to see a *RING* on a stone piece up
above.  Jump and grapple to the ring then swing over to the over to the top of
the pillar in the distance.  Hop over to the *LEDGE* of the broken walkway
ahead then pull up.  Walk to the left side and jump then grapple the *RING* on
the wall above to wall run.  Jump then grapple to the second *RING* on the wall
then wall run and jump to the walkway on the other side.  Follow the walkway to
the end then turn to the right to see two *RAMPS* (one is broken).  Jump to the
ramps and slide down to the walkway behind the sphinx.  Crouch and move under
the broken piece of the ramp to find a ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Pull the *SWITCH*
on the back of the sphinx's head to open a door below the sphinx.

-- Checkpoint

Use the *RAMP* on the right side of the sphinx to slide back to the ground
below safely.  Walk through the doorway then run down the twisting corridors
ahead until Lara reaches a room.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH SIX STATUES

Two panthers are trapped behind the gate at the far end of the row of statues
to the right.  Once Lara moves toward the middle in between the row of the
statues, the gate will open and the panthers will attack.  Stand on the fallen
wall debris by the first statue to kill them easily.  Run to the other end once
the panthers are killed and pull the *SWITCH* next to the room where they were
released from.  This will make the statues move close together and it will also
lower the gates that hold two more panthers at the other end.  Kill the
panthers then run to the other end and grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ in the right
room that held a panther.

The statues will have slid back in place before Lara finishes the fight and the
item collecting so move back across to the switch and pull it again.  Race back
to the other side of the statues then climb on top of the fallen wall debris
next to the fist statue and jump to the top of the tray that the fist statue is
holding.  Quickly jump across to the statue across from the first one to make
sure that Lara stands on the first of the left side of the statues as they move
back into place.

Leap along the trays of the statue on the left side then jump and grapple to
the *RING* on the left wall to start a wall run.  Jump to the *CREVICE* on the
wall up ahead then fall to the lower *CREVICE* and shimmy to the right.  Jump
to the right and grab the *LEDGE* on the gate then quickly jump up to the
*LEDGE* above the door before the door slides downward.  Move to the right then
jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the right.  Shimmy all the way to the right then
pull up once Lara is below the corridor above.

-- Checkpoint

Follow the corridor until Lara comes to a pit.  Slide down the *RAMP* and blast
the three rats that attack.  Pull the stone *BLOCK* out of the wall next to the
ramp and position it below the right side of the opposite end of the pit (next
to the debris).  Collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the left then climb up to
the block and pull up to the other side of the pit.

Run down the corridor until Lara stumbles upon another pit.  Slide down the
*RAMP* at the front of the pit and collect the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ at the end then
use the *CREVICES* near the front of the pit to jump back to the top of the
ramp.

Jump to the first *POLE* as it extends then quickly jump to the next *POLE*.
Line Lara up with the *SCARAB* figure below then jump to grab the scarab figure
and quickly hop up to the *LEDGE* of the walkway above.  Lara may lose her grip
on the scarab so quickly tap the /\ button then jump directly afterward.  Walk
toward the next area.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH POOL AND CAT STATUE

If Lara hangs off the edge of the walkway then a crocodile will show himself in
the tunnel below the door.  Jump to the floor below then blast the crocodile.
The crocodile is very fast out of water but his attacks can be avoided by
constantly moving.  Another crocodile will attack from the left side of the
pool ahead.  Run into the tunnel where the first crocodile was hiding and grab
the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the very back.

Run over to the far left side of the cat statue behind the group of pillars and
climb up to the walkway in the corner.  Collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ and
++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the hidden space.

Dive down into the pool and swim through the opening at the bottom.  Find the
*LEVER* at the bottom and pull it to open the gate to the left of the lever.
Swim through the opening quickly before the gate closes then surface to the
other side and pull up on the walkway.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH RETRACTABLE PLATFORMS

Hop back into the water and find the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the back right near
the bottom of the pool.  It is in a destroyed corner of the walkway making a
small alcove.  Surface to the top again and get back on the walkway.

To start off, jump to grab the *SCARAB* figure on the wall then quickly jump to
the *CREVICE* above as the figure lowers.  Jump then grab onto the walkway
above.  The walkway will start to move into the wall as Lara grabs on so she
has to perform this next part fast.  Run all the way to the right end of the
walkway then quickly leap and grab onto the *LEDGE* of the next walkway across
from the current one.  When Lara pulls up quickly run to the wall ahead and
jump to grab the *CREVICE* at the end.

Jump to the left to grab the next *CREVICE* and wait for the walkways to move
back out of the wall.  Leap to the walkway across from Lara then quickly jump
to grab the *SCARAB* figure on the right wall then jump again to grab the
*CREVICE* up above the figure before it lowers.  Hop over to the *LEDGE* on the
side of the walkway to the right then pull up.

Walk up the stairs and fall into the pit on the right side to collect the
++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the floor below then hop back up to the walkway.  Jump
and grab the *COLUMN* in the left pit.  Hop over to the *SCARAB* figure then
quickly hop up the next two *CREVICES* up above.  Leap over to the *PERCHABLE
COLUMN* across from the crevice then jump to the hanging *COLUMN* up ahead.
Climb up toward the alcove above then leap over to it.  Grab the ++50 CALIBER
PISTOL AMMO++ then pull the *SWITCH* on the wall.

The switch will make a platform in the last area move into the wall and the
stone block on top will crash to another platform.  Jump back on the *COLUMN*
then leap over to the walkway with the gate in front of it to collect the
++LARGE MEDIPACK++ and ++50 CALIBER AMMO++.  Jump back to the *COLUMN* and
slide down then fall to the ground.  Return to the room with the platforms that
move into the wall.

Drop to the first platform and push the stone *BLOCK* across to the walkway and
position it across from the two crevices on the right wall.  The block cannot
be pushed off the walkway thanks to the grooves along the side.  Leap over to
the fist *CREVICE* then jump to the next.  Jump and grab onto the platform
above then quickly jump to the next side as it pull into the wall then leap
over to the left *SCARAB* figure and hop up to the *CREVICE* above quickly.
From the crevice, jump to the right and grab the next *SCARAB* figure then jump
the overhead *CREVICE* before the figure lowers.  Hop over to the next
*CREVICE* on the left then jump to the *POLE*.  Position Lara below the *LEDGE*
of the walkway above then jump and pull up to it.

Face away from the closed gate.  A visible *RING* is hanging on the ceiling and
there is another *RING* on the drawbridge directly across from Lara.  In order
to get across, grapple the *RING* on the drawbridge then pull it all the way
down - Lara will let go of it once the bridge is all the way down.  Jump then
grapple to the overhead *RING* on the ceiling and swing across before the
bridge move back upward.  Run to the back of the alcove behind the drawbridge
then pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall.  The switch will lower the drawbridge
and open the trapdoor up above.

-- Checkpoint

Walk out onto the drawbridge then jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the right door
then hop up to the next *LEDGE* up above.  Leap over to the *POLE* across from
Lara then swing and jump to the *LEDGE* on the left door.  Hop upward to grab
onto the *LEDGE* of the floor above then pull up.  Walk over to the *SWITCH* on
the left wall and pull it to open the trapdoors around the cat statue in the
area below.

-- Checkpoint

BACK IN THE ROOM WITH POOL AND CAT STATUE

Walk to the edge of the walkway ahead but don't drop down just yet.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/3)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn to the left and find the *RING* on the wall.  Jump and grab the        |
| grapple the *RING* then wall run and jump to the *LEDGE* on the side of the |
| wall.  Rotate the camera and look behind Lara to see a *RING* on the        |
| ceiling across from the ledge.  Hop away from the ledge then grapple the    |
| *RING* on the ceiling.  Turn to the right and look up at the ceiling to see |
| two more *RINGS* up above.  Swing and jump then grapple to each of them on  |
| the way across to the rooftop above the cat statue.  Grab the --ARTIFACT    |
| (2/3)-- on the rooftop.                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Shoot the crocodiles from the rooftop of above the cat statue.  Jump into the
water below to avoid taking damage on the way down.  Walk over to the open
trapdoor around the cat statue.  Jump and grab the first *LEDGE* along the
bottom of the statue then fall along the *LEDGES* to reach the bottom safely.
Slide down the *RAMP* then continue down the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH CENTRAL PILLAR

Pick up the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ on the left and ++50 CALIBER PISTOL
AMMO++ on the right then walk toward the edge of the next room.  Fire at the
black panther below before dropping then fall down the platforms to the floor
below.  When Lara falls, three black panthers will be let loose from the room
on the left side, so have a heavy weapon ready.

-- Checkpoint

Walk into the back of the room where the panthers were held and collect the
++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from the back.  Run over to the *SWITCH* next to the gate
that holds two more panthers and flip it to raise the gate and release the two
panthers behind it - the gate must be released in order to leave this room.

-- Checkpoint

Hop up the two *CREVICES* to the side of the gate that just opened.  Jump to
grab the *LEDGE* on the gate to the right then quickly jump and grab the
*LEDGE* on the wall across from the gate.  Jump to the next *LEDGE* up above
then leap over to the *ROTATING LEDGE* on the right.  This ledge will move
around the right side.  Jump to the *CREVICE* on the left wall then leap up to
the next *CREVICE* up above.  Leap over to the *LEDGE* of the center walkway
then pull up.

While on the walkway, face the corridor where Lara entered this room and look
toward the alcove on the left side.  Shoot the *BUTTON* on the back wall of
that alcove to make a *RING* extend from the ceiling above.

-- Checkpoint

Jump and grapple to the *RING* then hop over to the walkways with the ++LARGE
MEDIPACK++ and ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++.  Swing back across to the middle
walkway.

Enter the corridor that the walkway leads to and follow it to the end.  A black
panther will make a surprise attack as Lara turns the corner to enter the next
room.

-- Checkpoint

The camera will show a portion of the ceiling with a horrifying sound to
foreshadow something.  Hop up to the *LEDGE* of the walkway across from the
corridor entrance then pull up.  Climb the *LADDER* on the right wall.

ROOM WITH SCARAB DOOR

A mummified jackal will attack once Lara pulls up to the area above - make sure
to move away from the edge with the ladder so he doesn't knock Lara back down.
There is a big set of doors with a scarab image on the front to the right but
it cannot be opened just yet.  Walk up the sand to the right and jump up the
platforms to collect a ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/3)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| While still standing on the block where Lara grabbed the large medipack.    |
| Jump toward the *RING* on the wall to the side and grapple it then stop     |
| during the wall run.  Climb up the rope a bit until Lara is right across    |
| from the top of the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* across from her.  Jump to the top of |
| the column then turn to the left.  Jump to the very narrow *LEDGE* on the   |
| pillar to the left then fall to the lower *LEDGE* and shimmy to the right.  |
| Leap over to the *LEDGE* on the pillar across from Lara then shimmy to the  |
| right some more.  Jump to the next *LEDGE* on the pillar to the right then  |

| Move to the right across the top ledge - all the way around the side - then |
| jump to the top *LEDGE* to the right on the other side of the pillar that   |
| Lara just jumped from.  Face the wall behind the pillar and jump to the     |
| *CREVICE*.  Jump to the right then grapple the overhead *RING* on the wall  |
| then wall run and leap over to the walkway above the doorway next to the    |
| scarab door.  Grab the --ARTIFACT (3/3) from the walkway.  To get back down |
| without losing life, jump and grapple back on the *RING* of the wall to the |
| side then lower Lara while on the grapple to the floor below.               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Walk through the doorway next to the scarab door.  Climb the *LADDER* on the
left wall and pull up then run down the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

TOP OF THE ROOM WITH SIX STATUES

Approach the *SWITCH* on the far wall and pull it to make the statues on the
floor below move stretch out of the wall toward each other.  The very top of
each statue has a flat surface that Lara can jump to and she needs to hop
across the statues to get to the other side.  This whole portion is timed so it
has to be done quickly.  Some of the damaged walls will block Lara from jumping
to certain statues so she will have to jump back and forth in between them.

The numbers indicate the order in which Lara should jump to the statues in.
Jump to them one right after the other without stopping.  Try not to make late
jump so as not to grab onto the side of statues.  This is set up as if Lara is
facing the statues from the side with the switch.
______
_____* <- Destination
     ^
     |
X    5
3 -> 4
2 <- 1

Grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the other side then travel through the corridor
ahead and pull the *SWITCH* at the end.  This will cause the two poles that
hold the scarab on the door to move back into the door.  It also causes the
statues in the room that Lara just came from to move out of the wall
permanently.

-- Checkpoint

Return to the room with the six statues and leap across them to get back to
other side.

-- Checkpoint

Climb back down the ladder and enter the room with the Scarab door.

BACK IN THE ROOM WITH SCARAB DOOR

Run into the sand and climb up the blocks where the items were earlier.  Jump
and grapple the *RING* of the wall to the side of the top block then stop on
the wall.  Move upward and line Lara up with the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* behind her.
Jump to the column then leap over to the next *PERCHABLE COLUMN* on the right.
Hop over to the *LEDGE* on the side of the wall then move across quickly since
the middle portion will start to crumble.  Jump to the left and Lara will grab
onto the small *POLE* sticking out of the other side of the door.  Lara's
weight will match that of the other weight suspended on the left side and the
trapdoor that was previously shown in the room below will drop a lump of sand
into the room.  Fall off the pole once the sand is released.

-- Checkpoint

Fall down the *LEDGES* along either side of the doors of the trapdoor to fall
to the big lump of sand.  Hop up into the corridor up above the sand then run
down the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

PUZZLE ROOM

Lara will emerge in a room with four pillars and several lightly colored blocks
around the sides of the room.  The door with the winged gold scarab on it will
not open until Lara solves the puzzle in this room.

Remove the lightly colored blocks from the walls to uncover a hidden alcove
behind each.  Some of them will have a panther behind them.

Start with the block to the right of Lara as she first enters the room.  Pull
*BLOCK I* out from the wall then run through the corridor behind it and collect
the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Walk over to the next block on the right as Lara emerges
from the corridor and pull *BLOCK II* out of the wall.  Pulling this block out
of the wall will cause the third pillar from the left to rise up and reveal a
circular stone below it with murals.  Enter the corridor behind the block to
see a mural with an Egyptian -HOLDING A GREEN VASE-.  Run back to the pillar
that just rose and grab the circular *STONE* then rotate it so that the
Egyptian holding a green glass is facing the door - a "click" will be heard
once this particular mural is moved to the correct side.

The next block, *BLOCK III*, does not have anything special behind it - just a
corridor that leads to a dead end.  Pull out *BLOCK IV* then quickly jump on
top of the block as the music starts playing and blast the panther from the
top.  Notice that this causes the pillar on the left side of the room to rise
out of the ground and reveal a circular platform.  Walk inside and grab the
++SHOTGUN AMMO++ then look on the wall to see a mural of an Egyptian holding a
-TRAY WITH TWO WHITE VASES-.  Walk over to the circular platform on the far
left side of the room and rotate it to display that particular mural.  A slight
"click" will let signify that it is in place.

Moving across the door, pull out *BLOCK V* and it will cause the pillar to the
far right to rise.  Enter the corridor to see an Egyptian holding a -FEMALE
FIGURE- behind the door.  Walk over to the far right circular platform and
rotate it to display this particular mural.  Pull *BLOCK VI* out of the wall
and move down the corridor and collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from
inside.  Pull out *BLOCK VII* to make the second pillar from the right move out
of the ground - this will also open the door ahead since the correct mural is
already in place.  Walk into the corridor to find an Egyptian -HOLDING A BLUE
VASE- on the wall, though it is already in position.  Pull *BLOCK VIII* out of
the wall then collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from the corridor behind
it.

So the correct sequence is:

Female Figure - Green Vase - Blue Vase - Two White Vases

Don't walk through the door just yet!

|=============================================================================|
| Push *BLOCK IV* to the right side of the wall up above where Lara pulled it |
| out from.  Hop on top of the block then jump to grab the *CREVICE* up above |
| followed by the next *CREVICE* then shimmy to the right.  Jump to grab the  |
| *LEDGE* on the wall across from the right side of the crevice then move to  |
| the right and grab the next *CREVICE*.  Shimmy to the right and leap up to  |
| the next overhead *CREVICE*.                                                |

| Hop over to the top of the pillar forming a *PERCHABLE COLUMN* across from  |
| Lara then jump across to the next few *PERCHABLE COLUMNS* (pillars) up      |
| ahead.  Leap to the *CREVICE* on the wall across from the final perchable   |
| column then shimmy to the right.  Fall and grab the *CREVICE* while on the  |
| right side of the wall then move to the right and pull up into the alcove   |
| above.  Grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ and the --MUMMIFIED CAT RELIC-- from    |
| inside the hidden alcove.  Hang from the side then drop.                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Finish the stage by walking through the doorway that was opened by solving the
puzzle.

ROOM WITH LARGE MIDDLE PILLAR

Walk through the corridor and enter the next area ahead.  Walk over to the
*SWITCH* on the right wall and pull it make the bridge on the current side
fall.

-- Checkpoint

Grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the front of the closest pillar by the switch.
Run across the bridge and collect the --EYE OF HORUS-- from the pedestal on the
other side.  This is the first of the four items that Lara needs to open the
other door on the outside of sphinx back at the very beginning of this level -
she has to place all the objects on the obelisk surrounded by water.

-- Checkpoint

Jump into the pool surrounding the pillar at the bottom.  Pull up to the
walkway with the pillars then check behind the third pillar to the right to
find some ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++.  Jump back in the water and swim over to
the walkway with four pillars on the opposite side.  Check behind the third
pillar to the right to find a ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  Swim over to the corridor to
the left of the walkway with the three pillars.  Walk through the corridors
until Lara comes across a pair of smashing walls.

-- Checkpoint

Time Lara's movement and run through the middle of the smashing walls when they
open.  Do the same for the next set.  Lara will come across two pairs of
smashing walls further down the corridor so time a run once again and run
through them as the first starts to open.  Enter the next area with damaged
debris at the end of the corridor.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH PLATFORMS, PILLARS, and ARROW TRAPS

Walk behind the steps and grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ below the ankh symbol.  Run
up the stairs and jump then grab onto the *ANKH SWITCH*.  This switch will
lower the platform directly across from the switch.  The switch will rise back
up and so will the platform, so jump away from the switch and jump on top of
the platform before it rises.

Leap over to the *POLE* on the left side then swing and jump to the *CREVICE*
on the wall ahead.  Hop up to the third overhead *CREVICE*.  Jump to the
walkway across from the crevice then pull up and run then jump to the platform
across from the walkway as the walkway starts to move into the wall.  Turn to
the right then jump (time it carefully) across to the *LEDGE* of the platform
across from Lara.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                           ARTIFACT (1/4) [Part I]                           |
|=============================================================================|
| Jump over to the next walkway across from the middle one that Lara is on.   |
| Pull the *SWITCH* on the wall to the left to make a *POLE* extend far       |
| above.  Lara has to be fast to make it up to that pole before it moves back |
| into the wall.  Read the rest of the walkthrough below and practice a bit   |
| before trying the timed run.                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

From the middle platform, hop over to the platform on the right (as if Lara
just jumped to the middle platform).  Grab onto the *CREVICE* on the pillar
then jump to the next overhead *CREVICE* and shimmy to the opposite side.
Arrows will shoot above Lara's head from a pillar on the other side.  Leap over
to the top *LEDGE* of the pillar across from the current one but don't pull up
since the arrows will hit Lara.  Shimmy to the other side of the pillar then
jump and grab onto the *CREVICE* right below the top of the pillar that is
shooting arrows.  Shimmy to the right then jump and grab the sloped *LEDGE* at
the very top of the pillar.  Jump to the *LEDGE* on the right wall then jump to
the *POLE* on the right and swing then jump over to the walkway at the other
end.

-- Checkpoint

Hop up the *LEDGES* on the wall to the left (in the back) then jump across to
the platform and pull up.  Keep moving while on the platform since it will move
into the wall and jump to the narrow piece of walkway with the pillar to the
side.  Hang off the *LEDGE* along the side of the walkway and move past the
first pillar then pull up.  Hang off the other end of the walkway then move
below the next pillar.  Jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the pillar above then move
to the left and jump over to the *LEDGE* of the pillar across from Lara.  Fall
to the *LEDGE* of the walkway below the pillar then move to the right and pull
up once Lara gets past the pillar.

Face to the left on far end of the walkway then hop over to the lowest *LEDGE*
on the right wall ahead.  Move to the left then jump to the overhead *LEDGE*.
The camera will display a *RING* on the wall above.  Jump and grapple the
*RING* on the wall then wall run and jump over to the *LEDGE* on the other end
of the wall.  I recommend that Lara perform two runs toward the wall since the
first run sometimes doesn't give enough momentum for her to jump to the ledge.
Shimmy to the left while on the ledge then hop across to the *LEDGE* on the
left.

Jump across to the *LEDGE* on the top of the pillar then shimmy to the other
side.  Hop over to the lower *LEDGE* on the next pillar then jump up to the
next *LEDGE* above and shimmy to the right to avoid the arrows as Lara jumps to
the top *LEDGE*.  Pull up onto the pillar then leap over to the *LEDGE* on the
side of the walkway above.  Pull up onto the walkway.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                          ARTIFACT (1/4) [Part II]                           |
|=============================================================================|
| At this point, to the right of this walkway is where the timed *POLE* will  |
| be that moved out of the ceiling from the switch below.  Swing across the   |
| pole and the --ARTIFACT (1/4)-- is behind the right side of the left        |
| pillar.  The timed pole will extend to allow Lara back to the other side    |
| once the artifact is retrieved.                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Turn to the left *POLE* then jump to it and swing then jump to the walkway on
the other side.  Move over to the left pillar and retrieve the ++LARGE
MEDIPACK++ from near the wall.

-- Checkpoint

Run up the sloped corridor ahead.  A mummified jackal will dart out from the
right side of room with the pillars as Lara enters.

-- Checkpoint

Fall down into the pit up ahead and collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ and ++50
CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from the opposite end then use the *LADDER* back at the
other end to climb back to the other side.  The two poles ahead will slide
downward as Lara jumps to them so she must jump on the first jump after landing
on each one.  Jump across the two *POLES* hanging over the pit then grab onto
the *SCARAB* figure on the wall ahead and quickly jump up to the *LEDGE* above
before the figure moves downward.  Move to the left on the ledge then jump to
the stairs on the left.

Move toward the smashing walls then quickly run through them as the once
closest to Lara spreads apart.  Quickly run through the other vertical smashing
wall then step out onto the walkway of the area ahead.  This is the room with
center pillar that contains the items that Lara needs - look below to see them.

-- Checkpoint

TOP OF ROOM WITH LARGE MIDDLE PILLAR

Turn to the right then jump to the first *LEDGE* on the wall and jump to the
overhead *LEDGE*.  Shimmy to the left then jump to the next *LEDGE* and shimmy
to the right and drop to the *LEDGE* below - the right side of the final ledge
will crumble if Lara moves across it.  Jump to the pole across from the ledge
then swing and jump over to the walkway across from the pole.  Pull the
*SWITCH* on the right wall.  The switch will make a bridge fall below and it
will open the gate directly across from the switch.  Don't jump down to collect
the item yet though.

-- Checkpoint

Hop back to the *POLE* and move back across the *LEDGES* to get back to the
walkway where Lara entered this top area.  Leap over to the long *LEDGE* on the
right side of the door then move all the way across it and drop to the walkway
on the other side in front of the closed door.  The cracked ledge will crumble
and fall so move across them fast!

-- Checkpoint

Walk through the doorway then follow it until Lara comes to some rotating blade
traps.  Time a run then dash past the trap when the blades move into the wall.
Jump to the next *POLE* when the blades move inside the wall then quickly leap
to the *LEDGE* of the walkway up ahead then pull up.  Move down the corridor
ahead and Lara will emerge in room with a long ramp.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH LONG RAMP

From the top of the room many items can be seen below, but some of them cannot
be retrieved just yet.  Slide down the *RAMP* to the left.  Lara will hit
another ramp near the bottom and start to slide down it.  A mummified jackal
will attack Lara as she lands.  Grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ once the jackal is
defeated.  Walk into the corridor across from the bottom ramp and collect the
++SMALL MEDIPACK++ from the middle.  Looking at the three stone blocks to the
side of the ramp, jump to the first one on the left and grab another ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++.  Jump on top of the third stone block from the right and pull the
*SWITCH* on the wall to the right.  This will make the top of the ramps slide
into the wall to form stepping stones leading upward, open the large gate to
the next room, and open a gate with a stone *BLOCK*.

-- Checkpoint

Grab the stone *BLOCK* in the alcove and pull it out then grab the ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ from behind it.  Push the *BLOCK* below the ledge up above the
alcove the climb on top of the block and jump to the first *LEDGE* then the
overhead *LEDGE*.  Move to the left then jump and grapple the *RING* on the
wall above to begin a wall run.  Wall run then jump over to the *SCARAB* figure
on the next wall then quickly jump up to the *LEDGE* above before the figure
lowers.  Jump to the left walkway.

Hop up the first few stone platforms leading upwards and collect the ++MINI SMG
AMMO++ and the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  The top block cannot be reached at the
moment so drop back down the blocks.  Jump to the *LEDGE* on the right wall
then hop up to the next *LEDGE* and move to the left.  Turn Lara's back (press
down) to get a good view of the area behind her.  Jump and grapple to the
*RING* on the ceiling as the spinning blade on the wall moves inward then jump
to the *SCARAB* figure and quickly jump up to the overhead *LEDGE* before the
figure lowers.

Shimmy to the left.  When the spinning blade on the left moves inward, jump to
the left and grapple the *RING* on the wall above.  Wall run to the left then
wall run back to the right and jump the instant Lara is about to turn and grab
onto the high *LEDGE* up above the one she was just on.  Jump up to the next
ledge then move to the far right.  Look to Lara's back (press down) to get a
good view of the spinning blade on the far right.  When the spinning blade on
the far right is about to move inward, jump and grapple the *RING* on the wall
above then wall run to the other side and jump to grab the *CREVICE* on the
wall on the other side - if this wall run is not timed perfectly then Lara will
take damage from the last spinning blade.  Move to the right on the crevice and
pull up to the second stone on the blocks.  Jump to the top block for a
checkpoint.

-- Checkpoint

Face the away from the top block and jump then grapple the *RING* on the wall
up above.  Wall run over to the opposite side then jump off the wall (press
away from the wall and Jump at the same time) then grapple the next *RING* on
the wall to the right.  There is an artifact below but keep moving across for
the moment.  Jump to the narrow walkway on the other side then jump to the two
*LEDGES* and shimmy to the left on the top ledge then jump to the walkway up
above.  Follow the corridor ahead and pull the *SWITCH* on the wall at the very
end to make a bridge at the bottom of the area drop.

-- Checkpoint

Don't jump down.  Go back through the corridor.  Jump to the *LEDGES* on the
right once Lara makes it back to the top walk and fall to the platform on that
side.  Jump and grapple to the *RING* below the walkway that Lara just jumped
from.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Stop while grappled to the ring then lower Lara and she will drop onto the  |
| ledge with the --ARTIFACT (2/4)--.  As long as she lowers while on this     |
| side then she will drop onto the platform with the artifact.                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Slide down the *RAMP* below the current block.  Fall down the rest of the
blocks then jump to the *LEDGE* then drop to the *SCARAB* figure and let it
lower.  Drop to the floor below once again.  Walk through the corridor past the
gate that opened on this bottom floor and follow it until Lara comes across
some more traps.

-- Checkpoint

When the spinning blades along the side of the *PERCHABLE COLUMNS* in the back
move inward wait for the smashing walls to go inward as well then quickly hop
across the three *PERCHABLE COLUMNS* and jump to the other side.  The spinning
blades will only hit Lara from the middle perchable column so she can pause on
either of the other two.  Collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ before crossing the
bridge ahead then move across the bridge and grab the --SEAL OF ANUBIS--.

-- Checkpoint

To the left of the corridor entrance (while looking back) use the two *POLES*
to swing across to the other side with the pillars.  The gate is still up on
the side that Lara swing to.  Walk to the right side of the third pillar and
find the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ and be sure to grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ in front
of the pillar on the far side.  Swing across the two *POLES* on the other side
and grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ and the --ANKH OF ISIS--.

-- Checkpoint

Turn around and enter the corridor ahead.  Crouch and move under the blades
then quickly jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in the pit then leap and grab the
*LEDGE* of the other side then pull up and run through the smashing walls when
it opens.  Jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUNM* up ahead when the smashing walls open
then quickly jump to the other side.  If Lara jumps as they open then sometimes
she will jump over the column and fall into the pit.  Continue down the
corridor.

-- Checkpoint

There is an *ANKH SWITCH* on the wall to the left that can be reached by using
the *LEDGES* on the left wall but DON'T GRAB ONTO THE ANKH SWITCH!  It will
activate traps (spinning blades) throughout this room and make Lara's life
miserable.  Jump to the top of the lower platform to the left then hang off the
side.  Drop to the *LEDGE* below the top of the platform then shimmy to the
right and drop down the next few *LEDGES* to the platform below.

Walk to the edge and find the three mummified jackals below.  Shoot them from
this platform.  Lara can also can also jump and use the *RING* on the left wall
to cross over to the platform on the opposite side for an even better view of
the jackals.  Fall to the floor below when the jackals are dead.

Climb up the *LEDGES* of the platform at the bottom and walk through the
corridor at the top.

-- Checkpoint

Lara will come upon a two sets of spinning blades that extend from the wall and
move backward and forward through the hall ahead.  Wait until the top set
starts to move toward Lara then stay in the middle and run toward them and roll
then quickly jump and somersault (double tap X) over the lower set - timing is
everything.  At the next part, jump toward the first *PERCHABLE COLUMN* as the
first set of smashing walls start to move apart then hop to the next two very
quickly and finally jump to grab the *LEDGE* below the spinning blade on the
other side.  Shimmy to one side then jump and grab the *LEDGE* of the walkway
above then pull up as the spinning blade moves to one side.  Follow the
corridor to the bars at the end then pull the *SWITCH* on the wall to the left
to lower the final bridge.

-- Checkpoint

Return to the previous room.  For the smashing walls part, jump to the first
*PERCHABLE COLUMN* as the first set of walls start to open (on Lara's side)
then jump to the next as the walls open then the next as the walls open.  Climb
up the left side once Lara grabs the *LEDGE* on the other side since the blade
stays in the right wall a little longer.  The same rule still applies to the
four blades at the end.

-- Checkpoint

Stay on the walkway at the end of the trap corridor then jump over to the
platform on the right.  Jump and grab the *LEDGE* above and shimmy to the left.
Drop to the lower *LEDGE* when Lara reaches the crumbled part then continue to
the left and jump back to the top *LEDGE* at the end and keep moving to the
left.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Don't grab the ledge of the walkway above, instead keep moving around the   |
| corner to the left then jump to the nearly invisible *LEDGE* on the bottom  |
| left and shimmy to the left.  Pull up and collect the --ARTIFACT (3/4)--.   |
| Fall back down the *LEDGE* then get back to where Lara was at previously -  |
| below the walkway *LEDGE*.                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump to walkway *LEDGE* and pull up to the walkway above.  Get on the small
platform then jump to the *LEDGE* above and shimmy to the left.  Leap over to
the next *LEDGE* on the left then continue to the left and pull up onto the
piece of the walkway.  Grab the next *LEDGE* on the right wall then jump to the
floor above.  Follow the corridor to the left all the way to the top.  Jump to
the top *LEDGE* on the wall ahead then shimmy to the left.  Hop across to the
platform across from the ledge.  Face the platform in the distance with the
item and jump then grapple the overhead *RING* to wall run.  Jump over to the
platform ahead and collect the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ and ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (4/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Jump and grapple to the *RING* once again then stop during the middle of    |
| the wall run.  Look to the right and notice the high walkway on the         |
| opposite wall to the right.  Pull up a bit while on the grapple then start  |
| a wall run once again.  Once Lara is at her highest possible position on    |
| the wall while running to the right press toward the walkway and press the  |
| jump button at the same time and she will jump toward the walkway and grab  |
| on.                                                                         |
|                                                                             |
| Pull up to the walkway.  Jump and grab the *CREVICE* on the right wall.     |
| The pole to the side will slide down once Lara grabs it so be prepared to   |
| perform one swing followed by a jump.  Jump to the right *POLE* then        |
| quickly leap to the walkway ahead.  Grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and |
| the --ARTIFACT (4/4)--.                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The safest way to get back is to return ground level.  Jump to the square
platform below then fall to the walkway below.  Move through the corridor and
hang off the right end of the walkway outside then fall to the next walkway
below.  Hang off the side that isn't damaged and follow that *LEDGE* to the
right then hop across to the *LEDGE* on the right.  Move across the *LEDGE*
then make it back to the ground below

Use the *LEDGES* to climb on top of the platform that the cat statue (on the
casket) is facing (basically).  Jump and grapple the *RING* on the right wall
then wall run over to the other side and jump to grab the side of the block
above the ramp.  Climb up the *LEDGES* on the wall above and climb up to the
platform that Lara fist dropped when entering this room.  Jump back to the
platform of the walkway then enter the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

Move through the traps in the corridor like before then leap across the *POLES*
to the left in the next room and cross the new bridge to pick up the ++SCARAB
OF OSIRIS++.  The gate in the pool below will open once Lara grabs the last
item.

-- Checkpoint

Jump into the pool and swim through the opening.  Swim all the way through the
corridor at the bottom and surface to the other side.  Pull up to the walkway
and collect the ++MINI SMG AMMO++ and the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ then pull the
*SWITCH* to the left to move aside the statue up above.  Climb the *LADDER* and
exit the temple (run to the right).

-- Checkpoint

After following the corridors ahead, Lara will reach the entrance once again.
Walk to the outside and a Centaur will make a surprise attack on Lara.  These
are the same Centaurs much like in the boss fight, but they fall easily to an
adrenaline attack.  Place the four items on the obelisk in the middle of the
area to open the big doors to the side and finish the level.

Walk through the big doors that just opened in the prior level to the left of
the sphinx that Lara came out of in the last level.  Run up the steps ahead and
two mummified jackals will attack as Lara reaches the top.  Kill them and grab
the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ and ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ behind the two back pillars ahead.

PUZZLE ROOM

The top portion has another puzzle for Lara to solve.  For this one, the murals
must mirror each other.  In other words, the ones that are across from each
other must have the same mural that faces each other.

** To line them up easily rotate the front left pillar and the back right
pillar two times in any direction.  The following is one example of how they
can face:


WHITE VASES   >         < WHITE VASES
FEMALE FIGURE             GREEN VASE
     v                        v

One they have been aligned, the middle trapdoor will open and a pillar will
rise up from the ground.  Hop up the *LEDGES* along the side of the pillar and
climb the top.  Use the man *LEDGES* on the wall above to climb up then jump to
the *LADDER* at the top and pull up to the area above.  Follow the corridor at
the top.

-- Checkpoint

Lara will come upon a set of smashing walls.  Hop over to the small platform
when the first set of walls opens then jump to the *LEDGES* on the left wall.
Hop up to the top *LEDGE* then jump to grab the *SCARAB* figure to the right
and quickly jump to the *LEDGE* across from the scarab figure before it lowers.
There is no reason to drop to the scarab figure below the current ledge unless
Lara didn't make a big enough jump to catch the *LEDGE* above it, so time a
jump and leap through the smashing walls to the left then grab onto the *LEDGE*
on the other side.  Shimmy over to the left then hop over the corridor across
from the ledge.  Follow the corridor and Lara will come to a place with stairs
on both sides of her.

SPHINX ROOM

-- Checkpoint

The wall up ahead is actually the back of a sphinx.  Notice the two switches on
each side of the room.  They are unreachable at the moment and Lara must go
through a series of puzzles to get to them.  Both sides of the room lead to an
area that will eventually lead Lara to the switches.

Climb down the *LADDER* on the left wall below then fall down to the bottom.
Collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the side
then continue ahead.  Once Lara reaches the front of the sphinx the camera will
show a locked door in the middle.  Two rats will attack Lara soon after that.
Facing away from the sphinx, check the far left alcove to find a ++LARGE
MEDIPACK++.  Climb up the ladder facing the sphinx.  Lara has a choice of right
or left at this point.  Let's start with right.

RIGHT SIDE OF SPHINX ROOM

Jump to the right at the top of the ladder and grab the *LEDGE*.  Shimmy to the
right then hop across both *POLES* to the stairway on the right.

-- Checkpoint

Lara can't jump the gap to the right so climb up the *LADDER* on the left.
Climb up the two rock platforms to the left at the top and grab the ++SHOTGUN
AMMO++ and the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.

Fall back down then move around the corner and jump to grab the first of the
*LEDGES* on the left wall then hop up to the next one.  Jump to the right and
grab the *LEDGE* of the top walkway and pull up.  Fall off the right side to
the platform below.  Walk over to the pillar on the right and jump to grab the
*CREVICE* on the front of it.  Shimmy and jump to grab each *CREVICE* on the
side until Lara works her way to the top then pull up to the top of the
overhead walkway.

Two gargoyles will start to fly toward the platform so move away from the sides
fast and fire at them.  Be sure to watch out for their fireballs and keep away
from the sides while fighting them.

Notice the item on top of the sphinx's head.  Walk toward the side closest to
his head and look above to see a *RING* on the ceiling.  Jump and grapple the
overhead *RING* up above then swing and jump on top of the sphinx's head and
pick up the ++DUAL MINI SMGS++.  Use the same *RING* to swing back across -
make sure to move close enough to the side so that Lara will actually grapple.

Jump to the *POLE* along the side then jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the walkway
up ahead.  Follow the walkway to the end then jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the
wall of the opposite side below then use the *LEDGES* to fall to the walkway
below.  Pull the *SWITCH* to make a platform rise in the back so Lara can get
back down the stairway in front of the switch safely.

-- Checkpoint

Walk up the stairs that lead to the doorway on the left and follow the corridor
ahead.  Jump to the extending *POLE* as it flies out of the wall (when the
first smashing wall moves inward) then quickly swing and jump to the next
*POLE* then leap to the *LEDGE* of the walkway on the other side and pull up.
Perform this part fast!  Follow the corridor to the room ahead.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH LIGHT PUZZLE 1

The switch on the wall up ahead (down the stairs) will only make the middle
pillar in the ceiling fall down and shine light on four top spaces.  The
objective here is to raise all the pillars by hanging onto the each of the four
panels below then climb back up to the top and pull the switch.

Panel 1     Panel 3

Panel 2     Panel 4

The easiest way to get started is to jump across the *LEDGES* on the left wall
then leap to the *LADDER* and climb down.  Leap to the next *LADDER* on the
right and climb down then jump to the top *LEDGE* on the left.  Drop down to
the next *LEDGE* below (middle ledge) then jump to the wall of *CREVICES* on
the left and allow Lara to lower down +PANEL 4+ with her weight.  This will
raise one the pillar to the side and cause a walkway to extend out of the wall
to the side.  Jump into the water below.

If Lara fell to the floor below first then she must climb up to the middle
platform next to the closed gate at the bottom.  Jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN*
in the water then jump to the *LEDGES* on the wall across from the column and
hop up them.  On the top ledge, jump to grab onto the wall of *CREVICES* to the
left then jump up them (there are four going up and the last one is bigger than
the rest).  When Lara reaches the top one, quickly leap over to the *LEDGE* on
the right then jump to grab the next *LEDGE* above.  Wait until the wall to the
side rises all the way back up then jump to the left and grab onto the
*CREVICE* of the wall, jump to the next and move to the left then quickly jump
and grab the *LEDGE* to the left.  For the next part, jump to grab the
*CREVICE* on the sinking wall then grab the next *CREVICE* above and then move
to the left then jump to the *LEDGE* on the left.  Hold away from the *LEDGE*
and quickly jump across the next four sinking *POLES* behind Lara and jump to
the *LEDGE* on the other side - stop on one of the poles and Lara must do all
of this all over again.  Jump to the top *LEDGE* then jump over to the left to
land on the wall of *CREVICES* and allow +PANEL 4+ to lower.

Panel 3 can be lowered anytime after lowering Panel 4.  Jump to the *PERCHABLE
COLUMN* in the water then hop up the two *LEDGES* on the wall ahead.  On the
top ledge, jump to grab onto the wall of *CREVICES* to the left then jump up
them (there are four going up and the last one is bigger than the rest).  When
Lara reaches the top one, quickly leap over to the *LEDGE* on the right then
jump to grab the next *LEDGE* above.  Turn to look behind Lara to spot a
*POLE*.  Jump to the pole then swing and jump over to the platform that
recently extended from the wall.  Leap over to the *POLE* on the other side and
jump to the *LEDGE* on the wall.  Jump to the right to grab the wall of
*CREVICES* then hop to the top crevice in order to lower +PANEL 4+.  Leap into
the water again.

Panel 2 is next.  Get back on the lowest platform in the water and jump to the
*PERCHABLE COLUMN* in the water then jump to the *LEDGES* on the wall across
from the column and hop up them.  On the top ledge, jump to grab onto the wall
of *CREVICES* to the left then jump up them.  When Lara reaches the top one,
quickly leap over to the *LEDGE* on the right then jump to grab the next
*LEDGE* above.  Wait until the wall to the side rises all the way back up then
jump to the left and grab onto the *CREVICE* of the wall, jump to the next and
move to the left then quickly jump and grab the *LEDGE* to the left.  Jump to
the next wall of *CREVICES* to the left then jump to the very top crevice in
order to lower +PANEL 2+.

Panel 1 is last.  Get back on the lower platform in the water and jump to the
*PERCHABLE COLUMN* in the water then jump to the *LEDGES* on the wall across
from the column and hop up them.  On the top ledge, jump to grab onto the wall
of *CREVICES* to the left then jump up them all the way to the top and stay
there to lower +PANEL 1+.  The camera will show the middle bridge extend all
the way across the top of the room and it will show the switch up above.

Jump to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* once again then leap up the *LEDGES* on the side
wall.  Jump to the left and grab onto the *CREVICE* of Panel 1 then hop over to
the *LEDGE* on the pillar across from it.  Jump to the *LEDGES* on the higher
portion of the pillar then shimmy to the other side on the top ledge and jump
over to the middle bridge.  Notice the artifact on the top right platform in
the back.  Hop across the two *POLES* on the left side (they lower) then jump
up the *LEDGES* and move to the right on the top ledge then look back and jump
to the *LADDER* across from it.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/2)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| From the position that Lara lands on the ladder from the ledge that Lara    |
| jumped to, leap over to the *LEDGE* above the middle section of the *POLES* |
| then shimmy over to the right.  Drop on the other side then collect the     |
| --ARTIFACT (1/2)--.  Get back to the ladder by grabbing the ledge again and |
| by dropping to the bridge in the middle then have Lara work her way back    |
| up.                                                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Climb up the ladder then jump to the next *LADDER* on the left.  At the top,
leap across the *LEDGES* on the right then jump to the walkway above.  Run down
the stairs and pull the *SWITCH* on the wall.  The middle door at the end of
the bridge will open.

-- Checkpoint

Move back down the ladder then jump to the *LEDGE* above the door and drop to
the bridge and drop.  Enter the room.  The doorway will seal and a mummified
jackal will attack.  Defeat him and grab the --ANKH KEY 1-- on the pedestal.

-- Checkpoint

The doorway behind Lara and the gate outside will open once the ankh key is
taken, so run back to the bridge and jump into the water.  Swim over to the
platform then move through the corridor behind the gate.  The corridor will
take Lara all the way back to the center area with the sphinx.  Defeat the
Centaur that shows up once Lara runs to the middle then climb the middle ladder
again and climb it.

LEFT SIDE OF SPHINX ROOM

Leap over to the *LEDGE* on the left this time.  Shimmy to the left then jump
to the piece of stairway below.  Leap over to the next section of stairs from
there.

-- Checkpoint

Stand on top of the small block up ahead then jump to the higher block up
above.  Slide down the *RAMP* to the left then jump to grab the bottom *LEDGE*
on the wall ahead and hop up to the *LEDGE* up above then pull up.  Leap over
to the sloped walkway then run to the top.  Don't try to make the jump to the
next side of the walkway!

Turn to the left at the top of the walkway then jump and grab the *CREVICE* on
the left pillar.  Grab the next overhead crevice then shimmy to the right and
grab the top overhead *CREVICE*.  Move all the way to the right then look
across to the next pillar and jump to grab the *CREVICE* on it.  Shimmy to the
other side of the highest crevice then jump to grab the *CREVICE* on the other
pillar across from it.  Hop all the way up to the highest crevice on the last
pillar then shimmy over to the right and look on the wall behind Lara to spot
some ledge on the wall.  Jump to the *LEDGES* and hop up to the top one.  On
the very top ledge look behind Lara then jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the
walkway above then pull up.

Two gargoyles will attack at the top so be ready!  Slide down the *RAMP* on the
other side after the battle then quickly leap across the *POLES* and jump to
the *LEDGE*.  Shimmy to the opposite side of the ledge then hop over to the
walkway behind Lara.  Jump to the *LEDGES* above the switch at the other end
then fall down them and pull the *SWITCH* at the bottom.  The switch will raise
the platform in between the stairs to Lara can back down safely if she needs
to.

-- Checkpoint

Enter the corridor behind the doorway off to the side.  When the set of
smashing walls move back into the walls along the side, run and leap over the
gap then move to the other side.  For the second set, jump to each platform
when the walls retract then crouch.  As long as Lara is crouching on a middle
platform then walls cannot touch her.  Carefully jump to the other side.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH LIGHT PUZZLE 2

Lara will emerge in a room similar to the first room with the overhead pillar.
Like the other room, the switch down the stairs to the side will only make the
middle pillar extend from the ceiling and spread light in four directions.

Panel 1    Panel 3

Panel 2    Panel 4

This room starts out like a mirror image of the last room with pillars.  Hop
across the *LEDGES* on the left side then jump to the first *LADDER*.  Climb
down the ladder then jump to the *LADDER* on the left.  Keep climbing down the
second ladder then leap over to the third *LADDER* on the right.  Move almost
all the way to the bottom then look to the left.  Line Lara up with the *POLE*
to the left then jump and quickly swing and jump across the next *POLES* until
Lara reaches the small *LEDGE* on the other side.  Drop to the lower *LEDGE*
then jump to the left and grab one of the *CREVICES* and leap to the top
crevice then hang on to lower +PANEL 4+.  Jump into the water.

Swim to the floor next to Panel 2 and collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ in the
water.

If Lara doesn't lower Panel 4 upon entering then get on top of the platform
with the piece of debris in the water and stand on the sloped debris then turn
and jump to the lowest crevice of the panel beside Lara.  Jump up the next five
*CREVICES* then quickly jump across to the *LEDGE* on the left side.  Leap back
to the third ladder on the left from this ledge and jump across the poles then
drop to the lowest ledge on the far wall and jump to grab Panel 4.

Panel 1 is next, so get on top of the platform with the piece of debris in the
water and stand on the sloped debris then turn and jump to the lowest crevice
of the panel beside Lara.  Jump up the next five *CREVICES* then quickly jump
across to the *LEDGE* on the left side.  Wait for the panel to the right to
move all the way back up.  Leap over to it again then hop up to the top crevice
and jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the right wall.  Jump to the *CREVICES* on the
panel to the right then hop up to the top and allow +PANEL 1+ to lower all the
way.  DO NOT DROP from the current panel!

(If Lara falls, then grapple the top of the Panel 1 and tug it to make it fall
then repeat the above steps.)

While still on Panel 1 (top crevice), jump to the *LEDGE* on the pillar across
from Lara then leap up to the top *LEDGE* and move to the right then jump to
the bridge.  Walk over to the left side of the bridge.  There is a *RING* above
so jump and grapple to the ring to wall run then jump on the *LEDGE* on the
wall across from Lara.  Shimmy to the right on the ledge then leap over to the
*CREVICES* on the panel to the right and jump all the way to the top to allow
+PANEL 3+ to sink.

Only Panel 2 remains, so stand on the piece of sloped debris on the platform in
the water then jump to the first crevice of the panel and hop up all the
*CREVICES* until Lara makes it to the top and allow +PANEL 2+ to lower all the
way.  This will extend the middle bridge all the way across the middle portion
of the room.

Use the *LEDGES* on the pillar across from Panel 1 to hop up to the top of
middle bridge once it raises.  Leap across the *POLES* on the right side then
jump to the *LEDGE* then the *LADDER* to the left.  Scale the *LADDER* then
jump to the next *LADDER* on the left and move up it, jump to the next *LADDER*
on the right then climb to the top.  Look to the left then jump across the two
*LEDGES* to get back to the top of this area.  Run down the stairs and pull the
*SWITCH* to open the doorway at the end of the bridge.

-- Checkpoint

In order to get to the bridge, move across the *LEDGES* once again and jump to
the first *LADDER* then the second *LADDER*.  Move to the middle of the second
ladder and line Lara up with the small *LEDGE* on the left side then jump to
it.  Leap to the left once again and grab onto the *LEDGE* up above the
doorway.  Move to the side then drop to bridge safely and enter the room.  The
door will seal off and another mummified jackal will attack just like in the
last area.  Defeat the jackal then grab --ANKH KEY 2-- on the middle pedestal.
The door behind Lara will rise again and the gate near the water below will
lift up.

-- Checkpoint

Jump into the water and move through the corridor to return to the middle area
with the sphinx.

BACK IN THE SPHINX ROOM

Two centaurs will attack once Lara returns to the front of the sphinx.  Run up
the stairs that lead to the door of the sphinx then place each of the Ankh Keys
in the grooves along the sides of the door to open it.

-- Checkpoint

Walk through the newly opened doorway and move down the corridors ahead.  While
moving down the sloped corridors seven rats will attack.  Lara can roll the
circular rock near the doorway along with her and push it over each rat to kill
it.  Other than killing rats the rock serves no purpose.

(Rolling the rock over a rat will make that kill NOT count toward the total
kills displayed at the end of the level.)

Be sure to pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ near the bottom and the ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ to the left as Lara steps out to the walkway overlooking the next
area.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH ANUBIS AND HORUS STATUES

Notice the statues below - Anubis (jackal head) and Horus (falcon head).  Look
to the far wall and a corridor will be visible on the high walkway on the far
wall but the water does not reach up that high yet.  In the area below, Lara
must raise the water level up to that walkway in order to reach it.

Start out by jumping into the pool below.  Swim over toward the portion below
the high walkway and dive toward the far wall in between the two statues.  Pull
the *LEVER* near the very bottom to drain most of the water from the area.

Swim back to the front of the statue on the right (Anubis) and pull up to the
platform holding the statue.  Find the *LEDGE* of the platform in front of him
and jump to it then pull up.  Jump up the next two overhead *LEDGES* then hop
over to the *POLE* across from the ledges and quickly jump to the *LEDGE* on
the other side before the pole lowers.  Shimmy around the right side of the
Anubis statue's foot.  Jump to the right and grapple the *RING* on the wall
then wall run and jump to the narrow walkway ahead.

Climb the *LADDER* then leap to the *LEDGE* on the left wall and hop up to the
next *LEDGE* then shimmy to the left.  Leap to the next left *LEDGE* then the
overhead *LEDGE* and continue to the left then drop when Lara is above the
broken arm of the statue.

--> Scarab Puzzle 1

Notice the scarab images on the floor and the scarab figure on the wall ahead.
Lara must shoot the scarab figures so that each of them turns to match the
images on the floor.

The scarabs are set up as follows:

Left  Down

Up    Right

Shoot them and arrange them in that order to open the gate to the switch above.
Climb up to the floor past the gate once the scarabs are lined up and pull the
*SWITCH* on the far wall to raise the water level to the statues' knees.

-- Checkpoint

Fall to the platform with the scarab images once again and climb the *LADDER*
to the side.  Jump to grab the top *LEDGE* on the right then shimmy to the
right and jump to the next *LEDGE* above.  Move to the right some more then
jump to the grab the next *LEDGE* on the right followed by the next *LEDGE* and
keep moving to the right.  At the end of the long ledge, jump and swing on the
*POLE* then jump to the *LEDGE* on the other side.

Jumping to the +ANKH SWITCH+ to the right of the current ledge will make a gate
in the water below open up.  This gate is timed, so Lara must quickly drop into
the water, swim around to the front of the platform of the left statue (Horus
statue), dive below the water and find the opening where the gate was then
quickly swim through it and surface on the other side.

--> Scarab Puzzle 2

While swimming through the opening, on the floor below (while underwater) to
see the images for the next scarab puzzle.  While facing away from the closed
gate (on the other side of it), the images will be displayed as follows:

Up      Left

Right   Down

Shoot the scarab figures on the wall above and positions them in the way
mentioned above.  DON'T PULL the switch behind them just yet though.

|=============================================================================|
| Drop to the next platform in front of the wall with the scarabs and push    |
| the stone *BLOCK* into the water in front of the statue.  Jump into the     |
| water and swim in between the statues to and pull the *LEVER* at the bottom |
| to drain the water once again so that it lowers to the statues' feet.  Swim |
| back over to the left statue (Horus statue) and position the stone *BLOCK*  |
| below the gate on the front of the lower section of the statue.  This will  |
| allow Lara to get into the area above without having to raise the water     |
| level.                                                                      |

| Return to the front of the Anubis statue and climb all the way back to the  |
| first scarab puzzle - up the ledges, across the pole, around the ledge on   |
| the foot, wall run on the ring, climb the ladder on the other side, move    |
| across the ledges again.  DON'T PULL the first switch - climb back to the   |
| ankh switch instead to raise the gate on the other statue.  Climb up the    |
| ladder, across the top ledge, swing across the pole, jump to the next       |
| ledge.  Jump to grab the +ANKH SWITCH+ once again to lower the gate at the  |
| front of the Horus statue.  Drop into the water then swim all the way to    |
| the front of the statue, pull up, jump on top of the block then jump to the |
| area beyond the gate before it closes.                                      |
|                                                                             |
| Climb the *LEDGES* on the wall (shimmy to the right on the right ledge)     |
| then jump to the platform above.  Drop to the side where Lara pushed the    |
| stone block off the side then hang off the side of the ledge along the      |
| side.  Shimmy to the far right then drop and grab onto the *LEDGE* then     |
| move to the right across the statue's leg.  Lara will eventually reach a    |
| broken piece of the ledge where she cannot move to the right anymore, so    |
| jump to the second +ANKH SYMBOL+ on the wall to the right - this will raise |
| a gate on the right side of the left shoulder of the Horus statue and this  |
| gate is NOT timed.                                                          |

| Drop and slide down the *RAMP* below then land in the water again.  Climb   |
| all the way back up the Anubis statue once again to reach the first switch  |
| that will allow Lara to raise the water level to the statues' knees.  Pull  |
| the *SWITCH* to raise the water once again then have Lara make her way back |
| to the first +ANKH SYMBOL+ that opens the timed gate.  Open the gate, drop  |
| below, swim back through the gate, and surface.                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump up into the alcove with the *SWITCH* and pull it this time to raise the
water to the statues' upper chest.  Swim out of the alcove after raising the
water and surface.  Swim over to the statue of Anubis and dive down into the
water and swim through the alcove where the first switch is then surface
through the hidden opening on the ceiling.  Pull up to the floor above inside
the statue.

-- Checkpoint

Jump and grab onto the *SCARAB* figure on the right wall then quickly jump to
the *LEDGE* above.  Hop over to the *POLE* across from the ledge then swing and
jump across the next *POLE* and jump to the *CREVICE* on the other side before
both of the poles move downward.  Shimmy to the left on the crevice then pull
up to the walkway near the right shoulder of Anubis.

Grab the *LEDGE* on the right wall then hop up the next few *LEDGES* and shimmy
to the right on the last one and pull up to the walkway.  Walk to the right and
move over to the gap in between the walkway.  Jump and grab the +ANKH SWITCH+
hanging on the wall over the gap to raise the water level again.  This time the
water level will rise up to the walkway of the corridor that Lara needs to get
to.

|=============================================================================|
| Be sure to enter the doorway through the opening on the left shoulder of    |
| the statue of Horus before leaving.  It is possible to collect this without |
| raising the water level for the third time to keep Lara from possibly       |
| drowning if needed.  Dive down into the water or drop down the ledges near  |
| Horus' left shoulder and swim/run through the entrance to find the --HORUS  |
| IDOL RELIC--.  Swim back up or climb back up the ledge and jump to the      |
| walkway behind Horus.                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Swim over to the platform of the middle walkway then follow the corridor ahead.
This corridor will lead to a room with several pillars.

-- Checkpoint

Upon stepping into the room a welcoming party of two mummified jackals and two
centaurs will race out from behind the sides of the pillars and attack Lara.
Use one of Lara's extra weapons for this fight since the combination can be
quite challenging.

Once the threat has been eliminated, walk over to the first red pillar on the
right then jump to grab the bottom *CREVICE*.  Shimmy to the left then jump and
grab the next few overhead *CREVICES* until Lara reaches the top one.  Move to
the left around to the other side.  While on the far left, drop to the
*CREVICE* below the current one then shimmy to the left until Lara reaches the
end of that one.  Turn to the red pillar across from Lara then jump to the
bottom *CREVICE* on the side of it.  Jump to the *CREVICE* above from the
current one.

REACHING THE RIGHT PLATFORM

Move to the right side of the current crevice.  Before reaching the far right
side of the crevice, turn to look at the blue pillar across from the current
pillar then leap over to the bottom *CREVICE* on its side.  Hop up to the
overhead *CREVICE* then shimmy to the right.  Jump to the right at the far end
of the crevice then grapple the *RING* on the top portion of the wall to begin
a wall run.  Position the camera behind Lara while wall running to make this
next part easier.  Jump to the top *CREVICE* on the blue pillar to the left
side of the wall.  Press toward the pillar and press jump at the same time to
make Lara jump toward it.

Shimmy to the left or right along the top crevice to reach the opposite side
then hop up to the very top overhead *CREVICE* near the ceiling.  Turn Lara's
back to the pillar across from her then jump to the bottom *CREVICE* on the
blue pillar behind her.  Move to the right, jump to grab the next overhead
*CREVICE*, move to the right some more then jump to grab yet another overhead
*CREVICE*.  Continue to the right then jump to the right and grab the bottom
*CREVICE* on the red pillar.  Shimmy to the left, jump to the next *CREVICE*
then the next *CREVICE* and continue around the left side.  Fall to the next
lowest *CREVICE* and position Lara with her back to the platform across from
her then jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* of the platform and pull up.

Walk over to the groove in the wall and use the Scion of Tihocan on the groove
to make a portion of the gate below slide back into the wall.  Fall down and
run back to the first red pillar.

-- Checkpoint

REACHING THE LEFT PLATFORM

Get back to the crevice right before the "REACHING THE RIGHT PLATFORM" section
then move to the left this time instead of the right.  Spot the *RING* on the
ceiling in between the groups of pillars.  Jump to the left at the far end of
the crevice then grapple the *RING* above.

Swing over to either one of the *CREVICES* on the red pillar that Lara will be
facing once she starts to swing - this will be on the left set of pillars.
Make sure that Lara in on the top crevice then shimmy to the left to move
around the side of the pillar.  Jump to the bottom *CREVICE* on the red pillar
behind Lara.  Jump to the overhead crevice.

|=============================================================================|
| Move to the left so that Lara is across from the blue pillar beside the     |
| current red pillar.  Leap over to the bottom *CREVICE* on the blue pillar   |
| behind Lara.  Shimmy to the left on that crevice then jump to the overhead  |
| *CREVICE* and yet another overhead *CREVICE*.  Turn Lara's back to the      |
| alcove behind her and jump into it.  Collect the --ARTIFACT (2/2)--.  To    |
| get back, jump back to the top *CREVICE* on the blue pillar beside Lara     |
| then shimmy to the left.  Jump back to the *CREVICE* on the red pillar      |
| behind Lara as she moves to the other side again.                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Shimmy to the right around the red pillar and jump to grab the next overhead
*CREVICE*.  Continue to the far right then jump to the right in order to land
on the platform ahead.  Move up to the groove in the wall and place the Scion
of Qualopec into the groove.  This will fully open the gate below.

AREA WITH BOAT AND CRATES

Lara will start this level in some water at the front of a cave.  Swim toward
the boat up ahead and pull up to the floor along the side of the cave.  Lara is
weaponless at the moment since her guns were taken from her in the cutscene
prior to this level.

Swim over to the waterfall and move past it then pull up to the hidden corridor
behind it.  Follow the corridor and leap up to the raised portion of the ground
ahead.  The corridor will lead Lara to a higher portion of the cave.  Jump to
grab the *POLE* to the right then swing to the *LEDGE* across from it.  Hop
over to the next *LEDGE* on the left side then leap to the *ROPE* holding the
suspended crate directly across from the ledge.

Fall from the rope and land on the crate then jump to the next suspended crate.
On the second suspended crate, look to the right and jump to the top crate on
the stack of crates and pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then jump back to the
suspended crate.  Find the *ROPE* dangling above the boat below and jump to it
then swing to the *LEDGE* to the left of the waterfall.  Shimmy to the left on
the ledge and jump to the walkway of the corridor beside the waterfall.  Follow
the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

AREA WITH METAL BUILDINGS AND CRATES/RETRIEVING THE RED FUSE

Lara will emerge in an area with some metal buildings, crates, and a railroad
track in the middle.  The blue metal building to the left requires three fuses
in order to work the controls inside and that is what Lara needs to spend the
majority of this level finding.  Follow the railroad track to the left.

-- Checkpoint

Two rats will appear but Lara cannot kill them in any way at the moment.
Constantly avoid them.  Jump on the mine cart at the end and grab the --RED
FUSE-- inside.  There is nothing else to do here at the moment so return to the
previous area.  Try to outrun the rats so they do not follow.

Run up the stairs to the left and enter the blue building to the side.  Walk
over to the groove with the red lights and place the Red Fuse inside of the
groove.  This will make the control to the side light up with a yellow light.
Walk over to the control and press the button on it.  The crate above the other
building across from the current one will move to the left and reveal a
corridor above the building.

RETRIEVING THE GREEN FUSE

Run back down the stairs and walk over to the set of small crates right near
the stairs.  Climb on top of the small set of crates then jump to the lowest of
the large set of crates beside Lara.  Leap and grab onto the side of the higher
large crate then pull up.  Collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then fall back down
the crates.  Find the movable yellow *CRATE* on the left side of the other
building across from the one Lara just entered and move it to a side of the
building then get on top and jump to grab the side of the building then pull
up.  Walk over to the newly revealed corridor.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Find the two metal beams that extend from the wooden floor to the right of  |
| the corridor.  Lara can stand on these beams, so jump to the first          |
| *PERCHABLE BEAM* then to the next.  Leap over to the single *LEDGE* on the  |
| wall across from the second perchable beam then jump over to the bottom     |
| *LEDGE* on the left.  Hop up to the overhead *LEDGE* then jump across to    |
| the *POLE* behind Lara.  Jump to the *RAMP* up ahead from the pole then     |
| quickly jump to grab the *LEDGE* of the high walkway beside the ramp.  Pull |
| up and pick up the --ARTIFACT (1/4)--.  Hang off the walkway then fall down |
| and get back up on the building.                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Hop over to the corridor and follow the tunnel ahead.  Leap over the gap to the
next section of the tunnel and keep moving.  At the end, drop to the walkway
below then push the yellow *CRATE* off the side of the walkway - this will
allow Lara to get back up to this area quicker if she falls.

-- Checkpoint

Jump to the next walkway up ahead then leap over to the lowest *LEDGE* on the
opposite wall.  Hop over to the next *LEDGE* on the right then jump to grab the
overhead *LEDGE*.  On the top ledge, move to the far left then jump and grab
onto the *LEDGE* of the walkway to the left then pull up.  Run to the opposite
end and jump to the *RAMP* and slide down then quickly jump to the next walkway
near the end of the ramp.  Leap over to the next walkway to the right then
follow it to the opposite end that moves over the fence below.  Hang off the
ramp then drop to the metal structure below.  Grab the --GREEN FUSE--.

Turn around and find the *RING* below the small metal platform above.  Jump
then grapple the *RING* and begin a wall run.  At the end of the wall run,
press toward the *LEDGE* on the opposite side of the wall and press Jump at the
same time to jump toward the *LEDGE* and grab on.  Move to the right of the
ledge then jump to grab the platform on the right.  Climb up the *LADDER* on
the wall then press to the left and jump over the fence to the side the grab
the *LEDGE* that extends across the building on the other side.  Drop to the
crate below then run back to the very beginning of this area where Lara can
place the fuses.

-- Checkpoint

While inside the buildings where Lara placed the first fuse, put the green fuse
in the groove with the green lights on it.  Press the button to the side of the
green fuse to move the crate away from the opposite building.  Press the button
next to the red fuse again to move the crate close to the stack of large green
crates outside.

So the controls should look like this:

Red Fuse --> Yellow Light  -  Green Fuse --> Blue Light

RETREIVING THE BLUE FUSE

Run back down the stairs and hop up on the stack of small crates then climb up
the large green crates beside them.  On the top of the tallest green crate,
jump to grab the *LEDGE* around the side of the suspended crate then move
around to the left end.  Jump to the walkway across from the left end of the
crate.

Enter the tunnel to the left of the far end of the walkway and turn right at
the intersection and climb down the *LADDER* at that end - the tunnel straight
ahead will only lead Lara back to the very top of the area behind the fence
where she picked up the green fuse.  Run to the other end of the tunnel at the
bottom and climb down the next *LADDER*.

Lara will come to an opening overlooking a room below.  Jump to the middle
*LEDGE* on the opposite wall ahead then fall and grab onto the lower *LEDGE*
and drop once again then slide down the *RAMP* below.

-- Checkpoint

DUMPING SITE

Another pesky vermin (rat) is lurking around below so try to avoid it as much
as possible.  Find the --BLUE FUSE-- on the ground beside the pipes and poles
in the back then jump on top of the metal structure to escape the rat.  Turn
around and look at the pipes on the side of the left wall.  Jump to the lower
*PIPE* when the steam stops then wait for it to stop on the higher *PIPE* and
jump to it.  Climb to the top of the long pipe then jump on the platform to the
side.  The camera will change the second Lara hits the platform so try not to
fall at that time.

Notice the rotating metal column that is shown up ahead.  As the back portion
of the middle part rotates toward Lara, jump to grab either of the *LEDGES* on
the back of the structure.  Allow the structure to turn to the opposite side
then jump either to the right (if Lara is on the right side) or to her back (if
Lara is on the left side) and grab onto the *LEDGE* along the side of the metal
dumpster to the side.  Quickly move to the right on the metal dumpster and jump
to the next dumpster on the right since it will start to tilt downward.  Shimmy
to the right on the second dumpster then jump to the *LEDGE* on the tall metal
structure behind Lara.

Shimmy around the corner to the right and line up with the *PIPE* so that it is
to Lara's back then hop over to it when the lower steam stops.  Climb up to the
top when the steam stops at the top then quickly jump across to the high
*LEDGE* on the tall metal structure to the side - try to line Lara's back up
with the ledge (slightly to the her right a little more than behind) and jump
without pressing a direction to grab it easily.  Move to the left across the
ledge then *LEDGE* on the wall across from Lara.  Shimmy to the right and hop
up the next two *LEDGES* then pull up to the alcove above.  Turn all the way
around while in the alcove then leap back over to the tunnel where Lara
previously dropped from.

Climb up the *LADDERS* once again and take a left when the path splits at the
top.  Walk to the edge of the walkway and hang from it then fall to the floor
below.  Run back to the building with the fuses and place the Blue Fuse in the
groove with the blue lights on it.  Don't press the blue fuse button.  Press
the red fuse button move the crate outside back a bit, then press the green
fuse button to position the crate over the building across from Lara.  Finally,
press the button next to the blue fuse to drop the crate onto the roof of the
building across from Lara.

Red Fuse -> Blue Light  - Green Fuse -> Yellow Light  - Blue Fuse -> Blue Light

-- Checkpoint

FINDING THE PISTOLS

The building will shatter the rooftop.  Run down the stairs and get on top of
the yellow *CRATE* that Lara positioned below the building on the opposite
side.  Jump to grab the *LEDGE* on the side of the building then pull up and
fall into the building.  Grab the ++DUAL PISTOLS++ off the small crate in the
back.  Shoot the windows to break them then jump out through one of the
openings.  Kill the two rats if they area around.  Lara can return to the dump
site to kill the single rat if scoring every kill matters that much.

|=============================================================================|
| Since Lara now has her pistols back, return to the beginning of this level  |
| by moving down the corridor that leads back to the waterfall.  Jump into    |
| the water below.  Get on the boat then shoot the metal piece that is        |
| between the wooden piece and rope that anchors the boat.  Wait for the boat |
| to float down the stream enough so that Lara can grab the first lowest      |
| *LEDGE* on the left wall (when facing the back of the boat) then jump to    |
| grab it.  Shimmy to the right and leap across to the lower *LEDGE* on the   |
| right then hop up to the top *LEDGE*.  Jump to the *LEDGE* behind Lara then |
| move around the corner to the right.  Hop over to the *LEDGE* on the right  |
| side and move to the right then fall into the hidden alcove below.  Walk    |
| behind the first crate and grab the --ARTIFACT (2/4)--.  Dive back into the |
| water afterward.                                                            |
|                                                                             |
| (The fist ledge MUST be grabbed as the boat first moves by it.  Lara will   |
| not be given another chance since the boat moves to the far end of the      |
| tunnel.)                                                                    |

|=============================================================================|
| Swim back to the corridor behind the waterfall and follow it to the end     |
| where the pole is.  Aim at metal piece at the bottom of the ropes that hold |
| the suspended boxes then shoot the first one to make it drop and fall open. |
| The secret music will play at that time.  The second crate holds nothing.   |
| Return to the bottom and walk up to the other side of the crate then        |
| collect the --CHALICE OF TORMENT RELIC (1/1)--.  Lara can still use the     |
| ropes that were holding the crates to swing back to the area above the      |
| waterfall.  Return to the area with the fuse building once again.           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Follow the tracks back to the area with the mine cart (where the first Red Fuse
was at).

-- Checkpoint

Near the mine cart, shoot the windows of the metal building above.  Climb on
top of the metal crate on the right side of the building then jump to grab the
*LEDGE* that extends across the lower portion of the building and move to the
left.  Pull up into the building then press the +BUTTON+ on the far side of the
control panel.  This will move the mine cart over to the side and position the
drill cart onto the tracks.  Fall back down and get on the back of the drill
cart then press the action button for a cutscene.

Interactive Cutscene: R1 - R1 - R1

Lara will automatically get the ++BLUE FUSE++ back directly after the cutscene.
Be sure to pick up the ++SHOTGUN++ lying next to the body.

-- Checkpoint

Run up the stairs toward the building with the fuses.  Place the blue fuse in
its slot once again and use the button next to it to raise the crate blocking
the outside railroad track.  Run back outside and get on the drill cart once
again then start it again to continue onward.  Allow the drill cart to drill
through the boards at the end of the track.  Follow the railroad tracks to the
end.

-- Checkpoint

LAVA ROOM

Jump to the pillar platform on the left.  Turn around on the pillar platform
and look for the guns on the rock in the lava below the side that Lara just
jumped from.  In order to get these, hang off the side of pillar that faces
away from the rock then drop and grab the *LEDGE* on the side of the pillar.
Shimmy to the left then jump to the very small *PERCHABLE METAL PIECE* in the
lava to the right of the rock - this metal piece in blends in very well with
the lava.  Hop over to the rock from the metal piece and pick up the ++DUAL 50
CALIBER PISTOLS++.

Leap back over to the metal piece then jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the side of
the pillar once again.  Move around the right side then jump and grab the
*COLUMN* across from Lara.  From the column, position Lara's back to the
*PERCHABLE METAL PIECE* beside her then jump to it - it is across from a ramp.
Leap over to the *LEDGE* near the bottom of the metal pillar to the side then
move around the left corner and jump to grab the overhead *LEDGE* then leap
over to the metal pillar behind Lara.

-- Checkpoint

Jump and grapple the *RING* on the outstretched metal platform up ahead.  Swing
then jump to the *RAMP* up ahead and quickly jump to the *POLE* across from the
ramp.  The pole will turn to the side as Lara grabs on.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| While on the pole, turn around and face the opposite direction.  Swing then |
| jump over to the rock with the shiny objects to collect a ++SMALL           |
| MEDIPACK++ and an --ARTIFACT (3/4)--.  Lara will just barely make this      |
| jump.  Hop across the two *PERCHABLE METAL PIECES* in the lava then jump to |
| the *RAMP* once and leap back to the pole - it will have swung back in      |
| place.                                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump to the *RAMP* ahead then quickly jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* on the
metal pillar across from the ramp.  Jump up the next *LEDGE* then leap to the
top of the pillar and pull up.  Turn to the right to spot a *RING* on the
ceiling above.  Jump then grapple the *RING* on the ceiling and swing then jump
over to the tracks with the shiny object.  Pick up the ++MINI SMG AMMO++,
another ++MINI SMG AMMO++ pickup, and a ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Jump and grapple
the same *RING* once again then swing back across to the top of the metal
pillar.  Jump to the side with the tracks up ahead then follow the tunnel.

-- Checkpoint

Jump on the rock *RAMP* to the right then grab onto the *LEDGE* of the rock
above.  Pull up then climb up the next two rock platforms up above.  Turn to
the right and jump to the lowest rock platform on the other side.  Jump to grab
the *LEDGE* of the rock platform on the left then pull up.  Turn to the left
and look for the rock *RAMP* on the left and jump to it then jump again to land
on the high floor above and a cutscene will trigger.

Interactive Cutscene: O - R1 - X

-- Checkpoint

Pick up the ++DUAL MINI SMGs++ from the obvious body.

TIP: Once the Dual Mini SMGs are collected this will activate another
checkpoint, so some of the below obstacles can be done before activating this
check point in order to keep Lara from performing them again if she dies!  Save
after this checkpoint since the last Artifact can be missed easily.

-- Checkpoint

Find the yellow *CRATE* on the right side then push it over below the rocks to
the right of pyramid.  Get on top of the crate then jump to the rocks above.
Climb and run around the left side to find a hidden ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ in the
back right of this area.  Fall back down the rocks.

Run over to the left side of the front portion of the pyramid and find the
other yellow *CRATE* and position it far left set of rocks.  Climb on top of
the lowest rock structure then jump and grab the *LEDGE* on the rock wall ahead
then jump and pull up to the top of the rock platform with the ramp to the
side.  Hop up to the next *LEDGE* on the wall ahead then shimmy around the
right corner.  Jump to the right flat portion above the ramp.  Rotate the
camera on this spot to see some items in a hidden alcove to Lara's left.  Jump
to the sloped portion of the left side of the pyramid then quickly leap to the
alcove - Lara can also fall along the side of the wall (in between the wall and
the pyramid) and leap to the ramp then leap up into the alcove.  Pick up the
++MINI SMG AMMO++ the other ++MINI SMG AMMO++ and a ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.  Move
back around the side and hop up the *LEDGES* then leap back over to the flat
rock portion of the ramp.  Hop up to the *CREVICE* on the left wall then jump
up to the top and pull up.

From this side, Lara must leap across the metal spires on the side of the
pyramid.  The spires with glowing markings on the side of them will sink into
the pyramid once Lara leaps to one of them.  Lara must leap to a total of six
++GLOWING MARK SPIRES++ in order to open the pyramid doors below.

Below is a diagram with numbers of the order that they can jumped on in order
to perform it all in one run and get the ARTIFACT at the other end:

(Please note that there are two sets of numbers (1-12 and 1-9))

|       = Perchable Spire
numbers = order to jump on them

(some of spires are leaped to more than once, hence the 47 below)

|=============================================================================|
| Once Lara reaches the far right side of the pyramid (the 2nd #9 on the      |
| diagram), she must jump to the last spire with markings then quickly jump   |
| to grab the *LEDGE* on the side of the rock hill up ahead.  Shimmy around   |
| to the left side then jump to the flat portion of the rock.  Pull up to the |
| top area and collect the ARTIFACT (4/4).  The jump from the spire must be   |
| performed the first time since it will sink in afterwards.  Once the spire  |
| is sunk in, the only way to get this is to reload your save.  Lara can get  |
| it at the beginning of the next stage, but it will not count then.          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once all six of the spires have been activate all the markings on the bottom
door will light up.  Lara has to use the remaining spires and jump back to the
top alcove in order to pull the *SWITCH* inside.

Slide back down the pyramid and enter the corridor through the newly opened
doors.  Pick up the ++MINI SMG AMMO++ along the way.

INCUBATION ROOM

Lara will eventually reach a room with a reddish tint along the side and plenty
of lit up markings along the wall and floors.  The red portion of the walls are
actually holding up eggs along the walls.  The door to the left is sealed so
run to the back of the room and collect the ++MINI SMG AMMO++ along with
another ++MINI SMG AMMO+ from behind the far right pillar.  Enter the next room
through the doorway ahead.

A cutscene will play as Lara enters the next room.  Lara will start out in the
room behind her a gargoyle and a jackal burst forth from the eggs along the
walls and attack Lara.

-- Checkpoint

Fire at the gargoyle and kill him quickly since his fireballs can be very
deadly - literally pinning Lara down.  The jackals are much like the mummified
jackals in Egypt.

Lara cannot do anything on the ledge where the cutscene took place so don't go
back there.  Walk back to the end of the current room and go through the newly
opened door on the right.  Follow the corridor behind it and climb the *LADDER*
to the very top.  Walk into the next room up ahead.

TOP OF INCUBATION ROOM

Two gargoyles will burst forth from the eggs in the room below and attack Lara.
Stay against the wall and kill them quickly.  Grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from
the right side of the walkway then the other ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ and the ++DUAL
MINI SMG AMMO++ from the middle portion of the walkway.  Run to the opposite
side of the room and find the doorway on the right.  Follow the corridor behind
the doorway.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (SECOND FLOOR)

Lara will emerge on a higher ledge in the lava room where the last cutscene
took place.  Look to the left and collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++, ++SHOTGUN
AMMO++ and ++MINI SMG AMMO++.

Look to the right to spot a *BUTTON* in the middle of the right wall.  This
button will extend a *RING* up above it when shot enough times so that the
markings around it light up, but it will also release a gargoyle from its egg
the first time after being activated, so deal with the gargoyle then shoot it
again.

This part is timed so all of the following must be done very quickly after
shooting the button.  In order to pass this part, after shooting the button
enough times, quickly jump to the grab the *CREVICE* on the right then shimmy
around the left corner.  Jump and grapple the *RING* then wall run and jump to
the lower *CREVICE* on the opposite side.  Hop up to the higher *CREVICE* then
move to the right and jump to the platform above and pull up on top of it.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (THIRD FLOOR)

All is quiet until Lara shoots the *BUTTON* on the right wall.  Another
gargoyle will attack her once she shoots it so be ready.  Shoot the button some
more to extend another *RING* up above.

Quickly jump to the lower *CREVICE* then the higher *CREVICE* and shimmy to the
left.  Jump toward the overhead *RING* on the wall then grapple it and wall run
then jump to the lower *CREVICE* on the other side followed by the higher
*LEDGE*.  Move to the right then jump to the next overhead *CREVICE* then leap
to the next platform behind Lara and pull up.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (FOURTH FLOOR)

Notice the three eggs on the wall.  Get a heavier weapon than the Pistols ready
because when Lara shoots the *BUTTON* on the right wall two gargoyles will
attack.  Don't fight them with the pistols alone - there is no reason to horde
ammo - and make sure to stay moving so Lara doesn't fall off the platform by
getting hit.

Shoot the *BUTTON* again so that the markings light up then notice that three
*POLES* extend from the wall to the right - two are right beside the platform
that Lara is on and the other is further ahead on the right wall.  A *RING*
also extends from the far right wall and another *RING* extends from the wall
directly ahead.

Start off by jumping to the *RAMP* on the pillar to the right then jump to the
lower *POLE* next to the platform that Lara is on and swing then jump
immediately to the next *POLE* on the first swing then turn to face the
opposite direction very quickly while on the pole.  Hold the opposite direction
while swinging on the pole and Lara will automatically change her swinging
direction.  Swing one time then jump and grab onto the *CREVICE* on the pillar
against the wall.  Quickly shimmy to the left on the crevice then jump to grab
the *POLE* across from Lara.  Swing one time on the pole then jump and grapple
to the overhead *RING* on the ceiling.  Wall run to the opposite end then press
to the left along with the jump button right before Lara turns around and
grapple the next *RING* on the wall to the left.  Wall run to the pillar ahead
and jump to grab the lower *CREVICE* on the pillar then jump to the next
*CREVICE* and shimmy to the left. Hop over to the next platform from the top
crevice.

-- Checkpoint

TALL LAVA ROOM (FIFTH FLOOR)

There is a *BUTTON* on the wall ahead.  Shoot it and two gargoyles will attack
as expected.  Fight them off then quickly shoot the button again to extend the
platform that Lara is on.  The platform will constantly try to move back into
the wall at a very slow pace, but Lara will fall if the platform is left
unattended.  The button will cause two poles to extend forth from the wall to
the side.  This timed run is not as hard as the last, but it must be done fast
since the timer ticks down at a quicker rate than the past timed runs.

Shoot the *BUTTON* then jump to the *RAMP* on the pillar to the side.  At the
end of the ramp, jump to the *POLE* up ahead then quickly swing to the next
*RAMP*.  Jump to the next *POLE* before reaching the end of the next ramp then
quickly swing then jump to the lower *CREVICE* on the pillar across from Lara.
Leap up to the overhead *CREVICE* then shimmy around the left side of the
pillar.  Jump to grab the side of the next platform then pull up.

TALL LAVA ROOM (SIXTH FLOOR)

Shoot the next *BUTTON* on the wall then fight off the two gargoyles that
attack.  The platform will continue to move into the wall like the last one
once the button has been shot once.  Shoot the button again and notice that a
*RING* moves out of the wall on the same wall as the button and another *RING*
move out on the wall to the side of the other.

Jump to the *RAMP* of the pillar to the side then quickly jump and grapple the
overhead *RING* and wall run then jump to the next *RAMP*.  Jump then grapple
the next *RING* while sliding to the end of the ramp then wall run and jump to
grab the lower *CREVICE* on the pillar ahead.  Hop up to the next *CREVICE*
then shimmy to the left and jump to the next platform.

TALL LAVA ROOM (SEVENTH FLOOR)

Grab the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the platform
up above.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/1)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Notice the *CREVICE* on the pillar to the side of the door.  Jump to grab   |
| the *CREVICE* then move to the left until Lara is below a secret alcove to  |
| the side of the pillar.  Climb up into the alcove and collect the           |
| --ARTIFACT (1/1)--.  Do not try to hang off the side and shimmy back across |
| since a gargoyle will pop out of the overhead egg and attack, just jump     |
| back to the platform from the alcove and quickly defeat the gargoyle.       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Follow the corridor ahead.  Lara will stumble upon many traps in her path.  Be
sure to grab the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ and other ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ to the left past
the first small pillar Perform a timed run to get through all the blades and
fireballs up ahead.  For the first set of fireballs, wait for them to shoot
then quickly run and grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then roll back.

-- Checkpoint

Walk up to the end of the corridor ahead.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH CENTRAL DAIS/DOPPELGANGER ROOM

Take out Lara's pistols and fire them to notice something on the far side of
the opposite end of the room ahead.  This strange figure fires whenever Lara
fires.  Drop down the *RAMP* and slide into the room below.

Three jackals will burst out of the eggs on the lower floor of the room and
attack.  Blast the jackals but be sure not to aim at the other thing that moves
around the around the room.  Once the jackals are dead, turn toward the figure
to see that it is a doppelganger of Lara.  It will fire whenever Lara fires and
mimic whatever Lara does.  The room is mirrored, so the doppelganger will climb
as Lara climbs.  Walk behind the two large pillars found along the sides of the
room and collect the two ++MINI SMG AMMOS++.

Rotate the central *DAIS* in the middle of the room - Lara's doppelganger will
help to turn it faster.  Two platforms will extend out from the bottom of two
sets of ladders mounted on the walls.  Jump toward the platform below the
ladder to the right of the side that Lara entered and pull up then climb the
*LADDER*.  Jump to the right and grab the *CREVICE* then quickly jump to the
walkway at the top to avoid the flames that spread out of the crevice - these
types of crevices will burn Lara's hands and make her let go once the flames
spread out.

Lara will land on a circular trapdoor and the doppelganger will land on a
*PRESSURE SWITCH* on the other walkway that will cause the door up ahead to
seal shut.  Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ while moving to the back of the
walkway then blast the gargoyle as it pops out of the egg up above.  Grab the
++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from the other side then pull the *SWITCH* on the
wall.  The switch will make the trapdoor open up to reveal a tube of lava below
it.

The trapdoor to the lava tube is timed, so perform this next part quickly.
Directly after pressing the switch, hang off the side of the walkway then drop
to the floor below.  Rotate the *DAIS* in the middle of the room then climb up
the opposite platform and *LADDER* than the one Lara came from.  Jump to grab
the *CREVICE* on the right then quickly jump toward the circular *PRESSURE
SWITCH* on the walkway to Lara's back.  This will cause the doppelganger to
jump into the lava tube on the opposite and kill her in the process.  A
cutscene will play once the doppelganger is defeated.

Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then run to the end of the walkway.  Another
gargoyle will bust out of the egg on the wall to the side, so blast it.
Collect the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the other end of the walkway.  This next part
is not timed like the first switch pulling was.

Pull the *SWITCH* on the wall to the side to open the door on the walkway
across from Lara.  Do not step on the *PRESSURE SWITCH* at the opposite end of
the walkway or the door will close.  This door will lead Lara out of the
current room.  Hang off the side of the current walkway then fall to the floor
below.  Run over to the *DAIS* and rotate it once again - it takes longer
without the doppelganger.  Grab onto the platform and ascend the *LADDER* on
the opposite side, jump to grab the *CREVICE* then jump on the *PRESSURE
SWITCH* above.  The pressure switch will not close the door now that the
doppelganger is dead.  Run through the doorway at the opposite end and follow
the corridor.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH HORIZONTAL PILLARS

Lara will emerge in a room with lava in the middle and a door across from her.
Each of the side areas contains a switch that will help Lara to reach the door
across in the middle.

Walk over to the right side and study the movements of the three pillars.  Lara
must run and jump across the three pillars right when they extend from the
wall.  Perform the first jump right as the pillars move out of the wall then
hold forward and keep tapping the jump button.  This will get Lara to other
side safely.  Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then pull the *SWITCH* to open the
middle doorway.

-- Checkpoint

A gargoyle will burst out of one of the eggs along the walls above the lava and
attack.  Kill him then hop back across the three pillars the save that Lara
made it before.

Approach the second set of three pillars on the left side.  Notice that the
spaces of the walkways in the pillars path have glowing marks trailing to the
end of the walkway.  In order to pass these, run past each one and stand in one
of the two spaces in between them that does not have any glowing markings.
Hold the walk button (R2) to move more precisely.  Touching the sides will not
damage Lara, so just walk against them to speed up the walking process a bit.
Walk over to the *SWITCH* on the other side and pull it to extend a bridge
across the middle portion of the area that leads to the doorway.

-- Checkpoint

Like clockwork, another gargoyle will burst from an egg below and attack Lara.
Walk past the pillars once again and move to the bridge.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                RELIC (1/1)                                  |
|=============================================================================|
| While standing in the middle of the bridge, aim at the dark *ROCK* on the   |
| ceiling above the doorway up ahead and shoot it.  The rock will fall down   |
| and crash through the floor in front of the doorway up ahead.  Walk to the  |
| edge of this new opening and fall down inside.  Lara will hit a *RAMP* and  |
| start to slide downward toward the lava.  Jump and grapple the *RING* on    |
| the bottom side of the bridge above.  Swing on the grapple then jump to the |
| tunnel that contains the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++.                                |
|                                                                             |
| Move further into the tunnel (to the left) and climb the *LADDER* on the    |
| wall.  Pick up the --TORC OF EMBITTERMENT RELIC-- from the top area.  Jump  |
| into the circular opening to the right then fall out the other side of the  |
| opening to land back on the floor above once again.                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Cross the bridge and pass through the doorway in the middle (jump over the gap
if Lara went after the relic) then keep moving to end the level.

Walk forward and enter the room up ahead for a cutscene.

===============================================================================
----------------------------> Boss - Abomination <-----------------------------

Immediately after the cutscene, Lara will be thrown into battle with a giant
creature on the floor below.

Most of this boss' attacks are close range, so make sure to keep some distance
between him and Lara and she'll only have to worry about the beast's ground
pound attacks.  He will sometimes lift up the back end of his body and slam it
down into the floor.  Lara must jump or dodge to the side at that exact moment
to avoid taking damage.  From up close, he will try to slap Lara with both of
his arms.  If his right hand ever grabs Lara he will either toss her away from
him or put her in his mouth and try to digest her.  The digestion attack is
escapable by pressing the R1 button while Lara is in the beast's stomach.  Lara
will shoot his head and jump out.

Just like any other boss, he has a life bar along with a rage bar.  The room
that Lara fights him in has three walls and a pit on fourth side away from the
door with lava at the bottom.  Shoot the boss in the head to fill his rage bar
and stand with Lara's back against the end with the pit.  When he charges, and
the screen blur, dodge to the side and shoot him when the targeting crosshairs
turn red.  This will cause him to tump over and slide off the side toward the
pit.  A cutscene will play where he will grab on with his left hand.  No matter
how much Lara shoots his right hand, he will manage to pull himself back up to
the floor above.  He will jump into the air while pulling himself back up and
come down with a ground pound, so be ready to jump or dodge to the side.  Lara
MUST knock him off once in order to perform the procedure below.

Shoot him some more to fill his rage bar then perform another adrenaline shot
while dodging out of the way.  Keep him away from the pit.  He use his left
hand in an attempt to smash Lara and will get his left hand stuck in the floor.
Target his left hand and shoot at it until it breaks apart.  He will slam his
right hand into the floor a total of three times while his left hand is stuck
so Lara must either jump or dodge to the side during each ground pound - try to
keep shooting at these times.

In order for him to swing with his left hand once again, Lara must knock him
off the side of the pit again.  He will lift himself back up, but afterwards he
will try to hit Lara again with his left hand after his rage meter is filled -
destroy his left hand even further at this time.  Lara must tear apart his left
hand in this way a total of two times - two cutscenes with his hand falling
apart.  If he ever keeps attacking Lara with his right hand while his rage
meter is filled then knock him off the side again to tire out his right hand so
he will use his left hand.

Once his left hand has been destroyed, he will no longer get it stuck in the
floor after being stunned, so once again, put Lara's back to the pit side of
the room and shoot the creature to fill his rage bar.  Dodge out of the way and
shoot him when he runs at Lara then target his right hand while it maintains
its grip along the side of the floor and fire at it.  If Lara has destroyed his
left hand completely then the boss will loose his grip and fall into the lava
below, ending the fight.

During the battle, there are two ++LARGE MEDIPACKS++ (front sides of room),
some ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ (in front of door), and two ++MINI SMG AMMOS++ (back
sides of room) lying around the room - these can be collected after the battle
also.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

ROOM WITH LAVA FLOW

Once the boss is dead, the door at the front of the room will open.  Run down
the corridor past the door to reach a lava river.  Jump to the flat rock in the
lava then to the second and grab the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the second rock.
Leap to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN* in the lava further ahead then hop over to the
next *PERCHABLE COLUMN* to the left.  Jump to the *LEDGE* of the platform up
ahead and pull up fast since an egg will burst open on the wall up ahead and a
gargoyle will attack.  Move forward a bit while shooting it and keep moving to
the sides so Lara doesn't fall into the lava.

Pull the *SWITCH* on the right wall to make the platform ahead extend outward.
The smaller platform that Lara is currently on will start to move into the left
wall.  Jump to the larger platform when it extends out fully and grab the
*LEDGE* along the side and pull up.  Run into the corridor to the right as the
larger platform starts to move back in place.  Pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++
along the way and keep following the corridor.  An artifact can be seen in a
high alcove but it cannot be retrieved at the moment.  Continue on into the
next room.  A Centaurs will make a violent dash at Lara from the next room as
she turns the last corner so be ready to shoot and dodge.

-- Checkpoint

ROOM WITH TWO LAVA POOLS

Walk over to the closed door on the left side of the room and pick up the
++LARGE MEDIPACK++ and ++SHOTGUN AMMO++.  Approach the *SWITCH* on the far wall
and pull it to close the door that Lara just came through and open the door to
the side.  This will also cause a gargoyle to burst out of one of the eggs on
the side wall.  Blast the gargoyle and enter through the newly opened door.

-- Checkpoint

POOL ROOM

As Lara reaches the bottom of the ramp that leads to the next room, a jackal
and a gargoyle will burst forth from the eggs on the sidewalls then attack
Lara.  Collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ and the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ from the
back of the room after the battle.  Jump into the middle pool and find the
*LEVER* on the wall then pull it to make a platform extend out of the wall
below a hidden tunnel on wall above.

Swim back to the surface and climb up to the platform below the opening.  A
jackal will burst out of an egg right next to the platform so pull on up to the
platform and shoot him from there.  Hop up into the opening and pick up the
++LARGE MEDIPACK++ inside.  Climb to the opening above with the metal *CAGE*.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Look behind Lara to spot an artifact on a high ledge across from the        |
| opening.  Jump to the ledge and pull up then collect the --ARTIFACT (1/4)-- |
| and jump back.                                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Push the *CAGE* off the other end of the opening and allow it to fall into the
first room with the lava.  Fall down into the room and position the *CAGE*
below the rock pillar.

-- Checkpoint

FINDING THE FIRST STONE PANEL

Climb on top of the *CAGE* then pull up to the rock pillar.  A gargoyle will
burst out of the egg up above and attack so quickly shoot him before he starts
tossing fireballs.  Grab the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ on top of the rock pillar.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Hop up to the metal platform to the side and pull the *SWITCH* to make the  |
| door below Lara reopen.  Pull or push the *CAGE* into the corridor and      |
| position below the artifact in the alcove that was visible while moving     |
| down this corridor earlier.  Climb up to the alcove and grab the --ARTIFACT |
| (2/4)--.  Position the *CAGE* below the same rock pillar once again and hop |
| back up to the top of the rock pillar.                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jump and grab the first of the three *LEDGES* above the small pool of lava and
move to the left then jump to the other two *LEDGES* quickly.  These crevices
will shoot out a flame and fry Lara's hands then make her fall if she holds
onto any of them for too long so move fast!  Jump to the *LEDGE* on the pillar
to the far left after moving across the third heated *LEDGE*.  Move around the
left side of the pillar then jump and grapple the *RING* on the wall behind
Lara and wall run then jump to the *CREVICE* on the rock wall above the lava.
Shimmy to the left on the crevice and jump up to the opening up above it.  Pull
up and collect the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ from inside the opening.

Walk to the other end of the opening and drop to the sloped portion below.
Pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ to the right then drop into the room up ahead.
Lara will land back in the room with the pool but she will be behind the set of
rocks that was on the right side.  Turn around and find the stone panel on the
wall to the right.  Jump and grab onto the *LEDGE* on the central portion of
the stone panel to drag it downward.  Fall off of the stone panel then quickly
turn and shoot the *BUTTON* that is revealed behind the top portion of the
panel.  This will remove one of the gates blocking the pipe inside of the
middle pool.  Jump to the flat rock behind Lara then leap over the stack of
rocks to get out of this area.

FINDING THE LAST TWO PANELS

The last two panels are in the room with the pool (look on the back walls) the
left panel is out in the open, but the right panel is above a pit of lava so be
careful when shooting the *BUTTON* above each one.  A gargoyle will burst out
of an egg once the button on the left side is shot.

-- Checkpoint

Once the remaining two buttons are shot, the pipe below will be fully open, so
jump into the water and swim through the new opening.  Grab the ++SMALL
MEDIPACK++ along the way then pick up the ++50 CALIBER PISTOL AMMO++ upon
pulling up from the pool.

-- Checkpoint

LAVA FLOW AREA

A slight tremor will hint that this area isn't very stable.  Jump over the
right side of the first lava river to land on the rock section between the
river.  Be wary of the lava drops that fall from the ceiling since they can
damage Lara.  Leap to the next rock section on the left then move around the
corner to the left.

Notice the ladder on the right wall up ahead.  Jump to the *LADDER* on the
right wall then climb to the very top.  Leap over to the *LEDGE* on the left
then quickly jump to the *LEDGE* above before the flames shoot out from the
side of the current ledge and move to the right before the fire burst out from
the hole below the higher ledge.  Stay in between the falling pieces of lava
drops and the fire burst hole.

Jump and grab the next *LEDGE* above and quickly jump to the left and grab the
safe *LEDGE* on the left pillar.  Jump to the next *LEDGE* on the pillar to the
left connected to the opposite wall.  Don't touch the Lava flow to the left or
Lara dies!  Drop to the small *LEDGE* below the current one and pull up then
collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ on the small platform above.  Hang off the side
of the platform once again then fall and grab onto the lower *LEDGE*.  Move to
the left just enough so that Lara can get her feet on the wall then hop over to
the *LEDGE* on the pillar across from the current ledge.  Fall down to the
lower *LEDGE* below then fall to the rock ground at the bottom.

The two rock pieces in the lava will sink as Lara jumps to them.  Jump to the
first then to the second.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| While on the second rock piece in the middle of the lava river, turn to the |
| right and jump to the hidden rock piece beside the lava fall - this rock    |
| piece will not sink like the others.  Jump to the rock walkway behind the   |
| lava fall and grab the --ARTIFACT (3/4)-- from the very back.  Jump back to |
| the rock piece beside the lava fall then jump back to the sinking rock      |
| piece.                                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Turn to the left (up ahead for those that got the artifact) while on the second
rock piece and leap then grab the lower *LEDGE* on the rock wall to the side of
the rock piece.  Jump to the overhead *LEDGE* and shimmy around the left corner
but don't move to the far left since lava drops are falling on above that
portion of the ledge.

Look away from the ledge to spot a perchable column across from the ledge.
Leap over to the *PERCHABLE COLUMN*.  Notice that the a flame burst forth from
the hole on the right wall every few seconds, so wait until it stops then jump
to the next *PERCHABLE COLUMN* then leap over to the long *POLE* up ahead.
Swing on the pole then jump to the rock piece in the lava then quickly jump to
the rock floor ahead before the rock piece sinks into the lava.

Turn to the left and jump to the rock piece then quickly hop onto the *LADDER*
on the rock wall ahead before the rock piece sinks.  Climb to the very top of
the ladder then pull up to the area above.  Walk a few steps ahead to activate
a checkpoint.  I recommend this checkpoint before trying for the artifact since
it has been quite a while since the last checkpoint.

-- Checkpoint

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (4/4)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn around once the checkpoint is activated and look on the ceiling above  |
| to spot a ring above the ladder.  Jump and grapple to the *RING* then swing |
| and jump over to the raised portion of the rock floor above - look for the  |
| flame shooting forth from the wall.  Pick up the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ from    |
| the side of the flame current then walk to the ledge in the back.  Hop over |
| to the first rock platform and collect yet another ++LARGE MEDIPACK++ then  |
| jump into the alcove to the right of that rock platform and grab the        |
| --ARTIFACT (4/4)--.  Hop back across the rock platform and swing back to    |
| the other side.                                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Walk through the doorway and enter the room ahead for a cutscene.

===============================================================================
----------------------> Boss Battle - Natla (round 1) <------------------------

Once the cutscene comes to a close, Lara will immediately be attacked by Natla.
Natla will fly to around the various portions of the room and shoot three
fireballs at a time downward upon Lara.  Stay at a distance from Natla and the
fireballs can dodged much easier since Lara will have more time to react by
jumping to the side or dodging.  Lara can also get behind a pillar to avoid the
fireballs.  Natla will also dive down at Lara and try to kick her when Lara
gets to close.  Crouch or perform a well-timed roll in order to avoid the
lunging kick.

Natla will teleport to different portions of the room so Lara will have to find
her frequently.  Aim for Natla's wings and fire at them to slowly drain her
health.  The cursor will usually highlight Natla's head, so manually switch to
a single wing.  Use the Dual Mini SMGs to finish this part of the battle
quickly.

There are three ++MINI SMG AMMO++ pickups and one ++SHOTGUN AMMO++ pickup in
this area.  Once half of Natla's life bar has been drained, another cutscene
will take place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
----------------------> Boss Battle - Natla (round 2) <------------------------

Natla will settle mainly for fireball attacks during this round.  Be sure to
stay at a distance from her since she will shoot out three fireballs more
rapidly at this time.  Lara can still get behind a pillar to avoid the
fireballs but it is best to stay out in the open and dodge them in order to hit
Natla while avoiding them.  Notice that Natla has a rage bar for this round.
Fire at Natla with the pistols to increase her rage bar.  The Shotgun really
helps at this stage since it will build her rage bar at an incredible rate per
shot depending on how close Lara is to Natla.

Once Natla is angered (full rage bar), she will charge at Lara and try to slice
Lara with one of her wings.  Dodge directly toward Natla as the screen blurs
and shoot the green stone on her back as the crosshairs turn red while Lara is
somersaulting over her - run at her and dodge aggressively.  Natla will be
stunned if Lara hits her directly in the green stone on her back, so take that
chance to shoot her in the green stone and drain her life.  Natla will only
allow Lara to take a certain amount of health no matter what weapon Lara uses
then her rage bar will instantly fall and she will go back to shooting
fireballs.  If Lara happens to miss the green stone then Natla will give her
plenty more chances while her rage bar drains since Natla will constantly
teleport away then dash at Lara again to perform another wing attack.

This is the final battle of the game so use any ammo or health items needed to
win the battle.  The Shotgun really helps out a bunch during this battle so
don't be afraid to use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Once Natla has been defeated, a cutscene will take place.

Interactive Cutscene: X - O  - O - R1 - [ ]

(Be sure to enable "Subtitles" from the "Options" menu under the pause menu for
the full experience in Croft Manor.  Some of the books contain clues that will
be in all caps in the subtitles.)

LIVING ROOM

Lara will begin her adventure in the living room of Croft Manor after reading
the note from her butler, Winston, in the beginning cutscene.  Start out by
examining the book in front of Lara (from the other side of the table).

"And even as their hooves shook the earth beneath them, Gilead gathered his
remaining strength and drew back his BOW."
-- The Trials of Gilead, Volume I

This is actually a clue the main puzzle in Croft Manor.  Lara can examine many
of these open books throughout the manor, and read a phrase from them.  After
examining most of them, she will mention "I've already read this one" when
attempting to read it again, but for special books that offer clues such as
this first book, she will always read the book upon examination.

Directly across from the bottom of the staircase, there is a *PRESSURE PLATE*
that will reveal an arrow behind a secret panel in the back of the fireplace
when stepped on.  Find the *CRATE* with red labels in the back of the stack of
crates to the side and pull it over on top of the *PRESSURE PLATE*.  Don't try
to get the arrow yet, or the fire will burn Lara.

-- Checkpoint

Walk back over to the stack of crates and climb to the top of the right set of
crates.  Turn to the left at the very top and jump to grab the top of the big
painting that forms a *LEDGE* and shimmy across it to the left.  Jump to the
left stack of crates then find the item on that side.  Collect the --SCULPTURE
GEAR++ then grab back onto the painting and fall on the tallest set of crates
to land safely.

Run up the main staircase.  Standing in the middle of the stairs and facing the
vase, the first door on the right leads to the Gallery Room, but it is locked
due to the security system, the second door leads to the Music Room, which is
the main goal for this level (it's locked).  The first door on the left leads
to the Library and the second door leads to Lara's Room.

Start by entering the first door on the left.  The hall will take Lara to the
Library.  Along the way Lara can find a few open books as mentioned earlier.

LIBRARY

The door will lock behind Lara as she enters and she cannot get out from this
room.  Find the *RED BOOK* on the middle left bookcase that stands out from the
rest and push it to make the bookcase to the right slide open and reveal a
hidden alcove.  Pick up the --MAZE MAP-- from the hidden alcove.

-- Checkpoint

Run up the stairs to the side.  A silver elephant will be visible in a glass
display at the top - this is actually one of the artifacts for the manor, but
Lara can't retrieve it just yet.  Enter the room on the other side of the
second floor.  Read the middle open book to the right inside of the room for
another clue about the main puzzle in the mansion.

"As he struggled mightily to calm himself, Gilead removed the poison ARROW from
its quiver."
-- The Trials of Gilead, Volume II

Find the two *RED BOOKS* that stick out from the bookcases in the back of the
room and press both of them to make the middle bookcase slide into the wall and
reveal another hidden alcove.  Retrieve the ++DUAL PISTOLS++ from the alcove.

-- Checkpoint

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (1/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Walk back out of the room and shoot the glass case with the silver elephant |
| then grab the --ARTIFACT (1/8)-- (the elephant).                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Find the painting across from the side of the second floor with no railing and
jump to the grab the top portion, the *LEDGE*, at the top.  The painting will
slide down and a button will become visible.  Jump off the painting to land
back on the second floor then quickly shoot the *BUTTON* to make the wall slide
back below and reveal a hidden entrance.

-- Checkpoint

Walk down to the floor below and enter this hidden corridor.

SECRET PASSAGE

Walk through the corridor until a stack of crates appear down the hall ahead.
Look to the left of the stack of crates and pick up the --EMPTY BUCKET-- from
the bottom shelf.  The crates can be destroyed with Lara's guns so shoot them
out of the way or just hop over them and continue down the corridor.  Lara will
reach a closed door at the other end, but press the *BUTTON* on the left wall
to open the door.

-- Checkpoint

GALLERY

This room contains all the relics that Lara has found throughout her
adventures.  If all the relics have been found then they will be displayed in
the surrounding glass cases.  Run up the stairs to the right and enter the room
on the opposite wall.  Examine the book on the far right end to the left.

"The concept of the sundial has existed for thousands of years and is one of
the earliest devices for time measurement.  (Lara) There's some numbers written
on the inside cover.  11, 2, 7.  I wonder what they refer to?"

Shoot the right glass display and pick up the --SUNDIAL GNOMON--.

-- Checkpoint

Leave the room and run back downstairs.  Examine the red *SECURITY LIGHT* on
the door to unlock it.  Walk out into the hall ahead and follow it to the end
to return to the second floor of the Living Room.  Walk across the stairs and
enter the second room on the left.  Follow the hall then open the door at the
end to enter Lara's Room

LARA'S ROOM

On the right side of this room is Lara's dressing room where she can change
into any of her unlocked outfits that she received from finding relics in other
levels.

Turn to the left upon entering the room and pull both sword *SWITCHES* on the
side pedestals to make the gorgon head open to reveal Lara's ++JOURNAL++.  Read
the open book to the right for the final clue to the main manor puzzle.

"And Gilead knew the GEARS of his heart would never turn again as he sacrificed
his one true love to save the kingdom he fought so long to protect."
-- The Trials of Gilead, Volume III

Everything else in Lara's room is optional material (open books) that has
nothing to do with the level, so exit the room and return to the Living Room.

-- Checkpoint

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

Walk down the stairs and stand facing away from the stairs at the bottom.  The
first room on the left leads to the Gym, the second room on the left leads to
the Pool Room, and the room up the small staircase to the right (in the back)
leads to the Garden Maze.  Open the door up the small staircase in the back
right and follow the corridor to the end.

GARDEN MAZE

Through the next door, Lara will enter the corridor at the front of the Garden
Maze.  Take the first left in the corridor - Lara can't fix the water system at
the moment further ahead.  Walk up to the Sundial and place the Sundial Gnomon
from earlier on the front of it.  This will activate the Sundial and allow Lara
to move it.

Move the sundial toward the following numbers found in the book from earlier:

--> 11, 2, 7

or

--> XI, II, VII

The dual shock controller will vibrate as the sundial points to each number and
a chime will confirm the correct number.  The gate to the Garden Maze will open
once the sequence is complete.

-- Checkpoint

Enter the Garden Maze.  The camera angle will zoom in to show Lara's Grapple on
the opposite end of the gate up ahead.  Lara needs to venture through the
garden maze in order to make her way to it from one of the other entrances.
There are also three artifacts in the maze - one in the southeast (look for the
target symbol on the map), one in the southwest (plus symbol), and one in the
north (middle block with four surrounding circles).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (2/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn right at the beginning then follow the trail until a split.  Take the  |
| right path and follow it all the way to an open area with grass in the      |
| middle. Enter the left path and follow it then take the first left followed |
| by the next right.  Pick up the --ARTIFACT (2/8)-- in the corner near the   |
| statue.                                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (3/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Turn left at the beginning then turn left when given the option again.      |
| Turn left again then quickly make another left and follow that trail to the |
| end to find this --ARTIFACT (3/8)-- near a plus shaped patch of grass.      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (4/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| It's more of your choice how you want to get this one since either side is  |
| long.  I'll give directions from the right side since it seems a bit        |
| shorter.                                                                    |
|                                                                             |
| Turn right at the beginning then follow the trail to a split and turn left. |
| Lara will emerge next to a tall statue.  Enter the path along the hedge on  |
| the back right across from Lara.  Take the second right followed by the     |
| first left. Lara will run down a set of zigzagging trails and emerge in an  |
| area with a large patch of grass.  Enter the trail ahead then follow it to  |
| the right.  Take the first left then move straight ahead to find this       |
| --ARTIFACT (4/8)--.                                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Turn right at the beginning then follow the trail to a split and turn left.
Lara will emerge next to a tall statue.  Enter the path along the hedge on the
back right across from Lara.  Take the second right followed by the first left.
Lara will run down a set of zigzagging trails and emerge in an area with a
large patch of grass.  Enter the trail ahead then follow it to the right.  Take
the first left then turn left again quickly.  Follow that path and take the
next left to emerge in the center.

Collect the ++GRAPPLE++ from the railing of the front right fountain.  Look
around the area and find the carvings for the bow and arrow around the middle
statues.  This is what the clues in the books were referring to.  The switch on
the ground in front of the statue cannot be used just yet.  Grapple the gold
*RING* on the gates of the entrance to this area and pull on the gate to pull
it open.

Exit the garden and return to the Living Room.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (5/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Since Lara now has the grapple, return to the Library (first door on the    |
| left [second floor]).  Grapple the *RING* hanging from the bottom of the    |
| chandelier and tug on it to make the bookcase to the right open up and      |
| reveal another secret alcove.  Collect the --ARTIFACT (5/8)-- from that     |
| alcove.  Lara can now exit this room from the door in the back.  Return to  |
| the Living Room and go back downstairs.                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Facing the fireplace, open the door on the left and follow the corridor behind
it to the fountain area then enter the gym.

GYM

Now that Lara has her grapple, she can perform most of the task in this area.

Walk up to the blue pad with the number "1" on it.  Jump and grab the *POLE* up
ahead and will swing around and position Lara in front of ledge.  Jump to grab
the *LEDGE* then hop across to the left *LEDGE*.  Leap to the *POLE* behind
Lara and it will turn just like the last.  Swing then jump to the *LEDGE* that
it will face.  Move to the right then hop over to the green *GRIPPERS* on the
right wall and climb them.  Leap to the *LEDGE* of the small walkway across
from the grippers then pull up collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++.  Press the
*BUTTON* on the back wall of the alcove to raise four metal columns near the
center of the gym.  Hang off the side of the walkway then drop to get back
down.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (6/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Approach the blue pad with the number "2" on it.  Leap to the *CREVICE* on  |
| the wall ahead then hop up to the next *CREVICE* on the wall.  Move to the  |
| left on top crevice.  Jump to the first *PERCHABLE COLUMN* across from      |
| crevice then jump to the next *PERCHABLE COLUN*.  Leap over to the *LEDGE*  |
| on the wall then shimmy over to the left crevice.  Hop up to the overhead   |
| *CREVICE* then move around the corner to the left.  On the far left, jump   |
| and grab onto the *LEDGE* of the alcove behind Lara.  Pull up and grab the  |
| --ARTIFACT (6/8)--.  Hang off the side of the alcove then drop to the       |
| *LEDGE* below and drop again to get down safely.                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Walk over to the blue mat with the number "3" on it.  Many areas can be reached
at key points from this mat.  Jump to the *CREVICE* on the wall ahead then hop
up to the next *CREVICE*

(a) Shimmy to the far left while on the crevice.  Jump and grapple the *RING*
on the wall behind Lara then wall run and leap to the *CREVICE* above the ramp
on the far wall.  Move to the left along the crevice then drop to the small
*LEDGE* below the left side of the crevice.  Jump into the alcove on the right.
Press the *BUTTON* on the wall to make a pole across from alcove turn to face
another way.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (7/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| (b) Shimmy to the far left while on the crevice.  Jump to the next          |
| *CREVICE* up above the current one.  Jump and grapple the *RING* on the     |
| wall.  When Lara runs to the far side, press toward the *RAMP* across from  |
| the wall and the jump button at the same time to make Lara jump to the      |
| *RAMP*.  Quickly jump to the next *RAMP* across from the first then quickly |
| leap to the *POLE* that was extended from the button that Lara pressed in   |
| step a.  The pole will turn so turn Lara around to face the alcove in the   |
| back of her.  Swing on the pole then leap to the alcove.  Collect the       |
| --ARTIFACT (7/8)-- from the alcove and slide down the ramp to get back to   |
| the floor safely.                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

(c) Shimmy to the right while on the crevice.  Jump to the next *CREVICE* above
then leap over to the *CREVICE* on the wall across from Lara.  Move to the
right so that Lara moves out to a *LEDGE*.  Jump to the *LEDGE* to the right of
the current one.  Drop to the lower *LEDGE* then shimmy all the way around the
right side of the *CREVICE* to the right.  Jump then grapple the *RING* on the
wall behind Lara.  Wall run then jump to the *CREVICE* above the ramp on the
other side.  Shimmy to the right around the corner and position Lara across
from the pole in the back of her.  Jump to grab the *POLE* and it will rotate
toward an alcove.  Swim then jump to the alcove and pick up the ++LARGE
MEDIPACK++.  Press the *BUTTON* on the wall to rotate another pole near the
number 3 pad.  To get back down safely, jump to the set of green *GRIPPERS* on
the wall to the side then climb to the bottom and drop.

(d) Shimmy to the right while on the crevice.  Jump to the next *CREVICE* above
then leap over to the *CREVICE* on the wall across from Lara.  Move to the
right so that Lara moves out to a *LEDGE*.  Jump to the *LEDGE* to the right of
the current one.  Leap to the *POLE* across from the ledge (behind Lara) then
swing and jump to the next *POLE* (this is the one that rotated earlier).
Swing then jump to the blue *COLUMN* hanging from the ceiling.  Hop over to the
next blue *COLUMN* then leap to the tall *PERCHABLE COLUMN* to the side.  Jump
to the next *PERCHABLE COLUMN* then leap to the metal walkway suspended above
the middle of the gym.  Grab the --WRENCH-- from the other end of the walkway.
To get back down safely spot the green *GRIPPERS* on the wall below the end
where Lara collected the wrench then climb down and drop.

Return to the Living Room.

(It's better if the water is turned on before entering the pool room, so the
pool will be full.)

BACK IN THE MAZE GARDEN

Open the door up the stairs across from the fireplace.  Follow the corridor on
the outside of the Garden Maze until Lara reaches the far end.  Use the Wrench
on the yellow *VALVE* then grab the *WRENCH* and pull it to turn the water back
on throughout the manor.  Walk over to the nearby fountain and use the Empty
Bucket to get a --BUCKET OF WATER--.  Return to the Living Room once again.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

If the crate was positioned on the *PRESSURE PLATE* in the Living Room from
earlier then the panel in the back of the fireplace is already open.  Stand in
front of the fireplace and use the Bucket of Water to put out the fire.  Grab
the --DECORATIVE ARROW-- from the back of the fireplace.

Open the door to the right of the fireplace to reach the Pool Room.  Follow the
corridor and open the next door.

POOL ROOM

Walk through the doorway ahead to enter the Pool Room.  It is under
construction still.  Grab the red *CONTAINER* full of planks and poles and
position it next to the right set of overhead walkways - push it up until the
board on the floor stops it.  Shoot the gold *PIECE* on the chain below the
piece of wood in the back to make the wood piece tilt.

Walk over to the stack of crates in the far right corner and climb on top of
the them.  Leap to the yellow *POLE* next to the tall walkway to the side then
jump and grab the circular *LEDGE* then extends across the second floor
balcony.  Move to the right across the ledge.  On the far right, jump to the
space in between the boards behind Lara, forming a *CREVICE*, then shimmy
across to the middle of it.  Jump to the wooden walkway across from Lara then
pull up.  Look to the left to spot a gold piece hanging from the spear of the
Athena statue.  Jump to *POLE* portion at the bottom of the object and Lara's
weight will eventually make the arms of the statue move downward causing the
spear to form a pole for Lara to swing across.

FINDING THE FIRST ROPE

Return to the *CREVICE* in the boards then shimmy around to the far right side
of that crevice.  Jump to grab the *POLE* portion of the spear then leap across
to the walkway up ahead.  Grab the handle of the small red *CONTAINER* full of
pipes and drag it over to the circular *PRESSURE PLATE* on the right side of
the single statue in the middle.  Notice the X marking on the ground in front
of the statue.  Grab ahold of the circular railing on the side of the statue
and pull it toward the middle X.  Rotate the red *CONTAINER* so that the pole
hits the spear of the statue.  This will make the panel behind the statue
rotate to reveal a hidden button.  Shoot the *BUTTON* with Lara's handguns to
open one of the gates in the pool.

Hop over the debris of the fallen statue and collect the ++LARGE MEDIPACK++
from the other end of the walkway.  Shoot *ROPE 1* on the chain to the side to
loosen the rope holding up the statue in the middle of the pool.  Return to the
other side of the walkway and jump back to the *POLE* followed by the
*CREVICE*.  Shimmy to the middle of the crevice then leap over to the high
wooden walkway that Lara was on before.  Jump to the pole, forming a *PERCHABLE
COLUMN*, extending out of the container that Lara positioned below then leap
over to the other side of the walkway.

FINDING THE SECOND ROPE

Move to the far end of the walkway then jump and grapple the *RING* on the wall
above and wall run then jump to the walkway on the other side.  Push the
*CRATE* on the right down to the floor below - this allows Lara to get back up
here quicker if she falls.  Run over to the walkway on the other side.  Stand
in front of the statue of Atlas then grapple the *RING* on the bottom plate of
the statue then tug on it to make Atlas drop the metal *SPHERE* in his hands.
Move the *SPHERE* over the circular *PRESSURE PLATE* in front of the statue to
open up the second gate in the pool.  Hop over the blocks on the right side and
collect the ++SMALL MEDIPACK++ then shoot *ROPE 2* tied to the chain.

FINDING THE THIRD ROPE

Walk back over to the portion of the wooden walkway where Lara pushed off the
crate just a few minutes ago and jump to the loose plank near that side.  The
plank will tilt, so stay at the first end until it starts to move upward then
quickly run to the opposite end and jump to grab the *LEDGE* at the top of the
wooden planks up along the metal structure ahead.  Move to the right then jump
to grab the next *LEDGE* on the planks across from the far right side - Lara
will turn in the air to grab them. Leap over to the walkway across from the set
of planks and shoot *ROPE 3*.  The statue will fall and shatter into the pool
below.

Fall into the pool below and grab the --DECORATIVE BOW-- from the remains of
the statue.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              ARTIFACT (8/8)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
| Swim into the hole on the side of the pool and follow the tunnel then grab  |
| the --ARTIFACT (8/8)-- from near the end.  If the gates are still sealed    |
| off then one of the objects above was not moved over one of the circular    |
| pressure plates up above.  Pull the *LEVER* on the right wall to open the   |
| gate that leads to the pool in the gym.  The lever cannot be pulled if the  |
| water is not on.  Surface and return to the Living Room.                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

RERETURNING TO THE GARDEN MAZE

Once again, go back to the Garden Maze.  Turn left on the outside corridor to
the to head back into the maze.  Walk through both sets of gates then place the
Decorative Bow on the left hand of the statue and the Decorative Arrow on the
right hand of the statue.  Walk back to the front of the statue and grapple the
*RING* on the panel while facing the statue.  Pull the panel covering off with
the grapple then place the Sculpture Gear inside the set of gears.  Pull the
*LEVER* in front of the statue and watch as the statue shoots the other statue.
The wounded statue will drop an item.  Run over to the statue and grab the
--MUSIC BOX CYLINDER--.

Return to the Living Room.  Run put the stairs and open the second door to the
right.  Follow the hall to the very end.

MUSIC ROOM

Place the Music Box Cylinder on the left panel of the door at the end of hall
to unlock the door.  Open the door to finish all of Croft Manor - the results
will display a few seconds after Lara enters.

Lara can interact with all the musical instruments in the Music Room.  She can
also play any unlocked track from the game over on the record player to the
right.

Total Game Completion = 100% (if all other levels are finished)

-- Version History

Version 1.0 - (July 2, 2007) - Walkthrough is complete!  I decided to spend all
of yesterday on Croft Manor even though I was thinking about adding it later
next week.  The guide needs some proofreading which I'll get to at a later
date.

Version 1.0 - (July 3, 2007) - Added my recently started blog address since I
forgot to put it in here in the first version.  Check the "About Me" section.
I'll be adding some more room/area names on the next update so readers won't
have to read through so many paragraphs in the walkthrough section.

Version 1.1 - (August 13, 2007) - Added a note about a bug in the St. Francis
Folly area - the Damocles Room.  Also added a note about how to turn the
commentaries on and some more info about the cheats in the reward section.

Version 1.2 - (October 3, 2007) - Added some information on the quick turn
while swinging on poles.  Information was added at the top portion under
"Poles" and on the Fourth Floor of The Great Pyramid stage.

Version 1.2 - (November 26, 2007) - Corrected a few minor typos.  I might add
some more info to this guide before the end of the year since more version of
TR:A have been released - I'm noticing that it really needs a weapons section
with locations for each, not to mention a good proofreading.

Version 1.3 - (December 29, 2007) - The Xbox 360 achievements for the game were
added at the bottom of the Rewards section and I added an extra note under the
Centaur battle since I receive quite a few emails about grappling their
shields.

Version 1.3 - (January 7, 2008) - Changed a bit of wording here and there
thanks to some feedback from a reader - mainly dealing with the adrenaline
dodge.  Just a little note, if anyone ever finds the wording in a particular
area a little off then please email me and point out the particular area of the
walkthrough where it is located.

-- Contact Info

I can be reached at my email address, which is > berserker_kev @ yahoo.com <,
so please contact me if you have any questions, comments, etc.  I don't mind
receiving emails at all.  All I ask is for you to try to make the email decent.
I realize that some people do not speak perfect English or cannot type that
well, so that doesn't really matter to me, but all that I ask is that you try
to make it readable.  If you found this walkthrough helpful, an email would be
most appreciated.

I would prefer you not to add me to your messenger, but if you do, at least
tell me a bit about yourself and why, or if I know you, tell me who you are.
One of my pet peeves is when people just add me to their messenger without
saying anything.  I usually just deny their request.

-- About Me

Well, my name is Kevin.  I'm 27 years old (as of March 2007) and reside in the
US (Mississippi).  I've been an avid player of video games ever since I first
got an Atari 2600 back when I was 6 years old.  I've tried to escape into many
other hobbies but always wind up back to square one with video games.  My
favorite gaming series is Resident Evil by far, then second would be
Castlevania.  Playing just about any survival horror is a major high point in
my gaming experience.

A few of my other interests include horror movies, anime, and I'm a complete
message board junkie.  You can find me at Artic Nightfall (Berserker) or the
Resident Evil or Castlevania IGN message boards (berserker_kev) from time to
time.  I'm also a big fan of viewing artwork, though I can't draw myself.  Even
though I can't draw, I try to be a creative person through writing, and
hopefully that reflects in my guides.  My dream is to be a professional
walkthrough writer, but until then I will continue to publish guides for free
on GameFAQs and the various other gaming sites.

For any other info about me, please see my FAQ Writer of the Month interview at
IGN:

-- Berserker's blog.

My own site with game reviews, discussions of my guides (some), and random
thoughts about video games.  Feel free to post up some comments on the blog.  I
don't bite... well not that much... and not too viciously...
