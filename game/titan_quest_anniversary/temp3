***I. A Troubled Village***
   *********************
===================
===Road to Helos===
===================
When the game start, talk to Corythus and he will tell you to head down to the
town Helos. Walk south east down the road and talk to Timaeus to get your first
quest. Head towards the exclaimation mark and kill the satyrs that are
attacking the horse. After that go back and talk to Timaeus. Continue down the
road and go into the town of Helos.

===========
===Helos===
===========
Head northeast into the town until you see
a fat man with a red cloth coming down from his left shoulder. He is Diomedes.
Go talk to him to update the quest. Go head north and leave Helos.

====================
===Helos Farmland===
====================
Keep going north and kill the monsters on your way. Pick up any equipment on
the floor since they are better than nothing. Keep going north until you see
the grass turn green. There is a chest there. Quickly kill the monsters and
open it. It contains a couple health potions which you might need. Continue
north and into Helos Woods.

=================
===Helos Woods===
=================
Head north and follow the path. It will end when you get to between two rocks,
but keep going north and follow the exclaimation mark. The shaman boss has a
some satyrs around him. I suggest killing them first since they are easier,
then go after the shaman. Use the health potions if you health gets low. After
you kill the shaman, head back to Helos and talk to Diomedes to get your reward
and the next quest.

   *******************
***II. Spartans at War***

Now exit the cave and go to the Rebirth Fountain. Follow the road again and
go north into the forest.

===================
===Laconia Woods===
===================
This part is somewhat hard if you are at a low level. There are huge flocks of

a huge fat satyr and a bunch of smaller ones with an aura around them. Kill
them all and return down to Euphadimus for your reward.

Go back up the hill and there will be a path. It is kind of broken up on the
map so it might be hard to see. It leads north east and along the path there
will be a man, Theages, there. Talk to him to get a side quest

Theages for your reward.

Get back on the path and it should lead you north west. You will come across a
Rebirth Fountain and a man named Parmenides. He only tells you the Spartan army
is up ahead so talk to him if you want and then head across the bridge.

==================
===Spartan Road===
==================
This area has skeleton monsters. Some will pop out of the ground when you get
near them so becareful where you walk. Take the path north east and you will
come to a fork in the road. The east path takes you to some ruins, but you
don't need to go there so take the west path. Go north and you will see the war
camp. The camp will be attacked by satyrs. Assist the guards if you want, but
it is not necessary.

======================
===Spartan War-Camp===
======================
At the war camp, talk to Brasidas to update the quest. He is just north of the
first NPC you see after you enter the warcamp. Now go east/northeast and take
the exit to Pellana Valley.

Before leaving the war camp, talk to Euthycles to get the quest then exit the
camp into Pellana Valley.

====================
===Pellana Valley===
====================
Take the path east into a camp inhabited by satyrs. Go north a little and you
will see a yellow dot with an exclaimation mark in it. Keep going north and you
will do battle with the centaur. It will seem like it is alone, but once you
attack him, more centaurs will come to his aid so be careful about that.

---Side Quest: The Ancient of War---
Go halfway between the exclaimation mark icon and the camp go east and you will
find Hippias sitting on a rock so talk to him and return to to Euthycles for
your reward.

Now go tell Brasidas about the defeated centaur and then talk to Leonidas to
get another quest.

   ****************************
***III. The Words of the Oracle***
   ****************************
From the warcamp, take the east exit again and back to where you fought the
centaur. From there go north into to highlands.

=======================
===Spartan Highlands===
=======================
Follow the path north first, but it will eventually end. Go north a little more
and then go west as soon as you can and the north again. You know you will be
going the correct way when you encounter a Rebirth Fountain. From the fountain
go north and then northeast when you see some fence things and some really tall
torches. From there go east past the fences and then south. Now go east into
the Mycenean Ruins.

====================
===Mycenean Ruins===
====================
This place is fill with undeads. Again, some will only pop up from the ground
only if you get close enough to them. The best thing to do is to avoid the
ruins to the north east. Just head north, between two rocks, and there will be
a Rebirth Fountain. Go northwest a little and into the woods.

===================
===Spartan Woods===
===================
Head northwest along the walls. You will come across a camp full of satyrs.
Kill them or run away. A path can be seen from there so follow it north into
Tegea.

======================
===Village of Tegea===
======================
---Side Quest: The Poisoned Spring---
Reward: 1500 EXP, 75 Health Bonus
	30000 EXP, 150 Health Bonus
Talk to Olorus by the Rebirth Fountain for the quest. Then take the northwest
exit into Tegea Forest. Go southwest until you see some water then go
northwest toward the POI icon. Talk to Pegaea to get an update on the quest
and enter the cave. Go northwest in the cave and you will pass by some water
and a wall that is L shaped. Keep going northwest and there will be a group
of spiders with auras around them. Kill them and two or three more groups
and return to Pegaea for your reward.

There isn't much in this village so take the north east exit to Arcadia.

=============

Go northwest. Keep going that way until you come to an area where a path
starts. Go north through the trees and into Megara Bluffs.

==================
===Megara Bluff===

minimap. Keep going northeast and you will come to a camp with maenads. Get
pass them and go north into Megara Coast.

water because if you get too close to a wrecked ship, wraiths will appear. You

hallway and go northwest. Go southwest into the first room you see and one of
the prince will be there. Kill him and go back into the hallway. Make your way
down the same direction and it will take you into another room. As soon as you
enter go northeast and another of the prince is there. From the entrance of
this room go southeast and go into the next room. Go southeast down the hallway
and turn into the first room to kill the last prince and you will get your
reward.

Go northwest a little more and follow the road

===================
===Halcyon Coast===
===================
As soon as you go northwest a group of guards will follow you. If you keep
going further, a cyclops will appear. It is very strong so you have to watch
your health. The guards that followed you will help, but they won't do much
since they will be the first to get killed. You don't have to fight it so you
can just run away. After defeating the cyclops of if you're running go west
and then north when you see the ground change. Go north pass the torches.

---Side Quest: News of a Shipwreck---
From the torches go north a little and then make a left U turn between two
rocks. Head south a bit and some wraiths will appear. Kill them all to complete
the quest and open the chests for some loot.

Go back to the area before you made that U turn. Go northwest and you will come
to a fork. You can take either way, but the north path is faster. The ground
will turn back to grass and a Rebirth Fountain will be nearby. Go northwest
pass the torches to the next area.

============
===Boetia===
============
From the Rebirth Fountain go northwest a little and there will be a road.
Follow it until it ends, the go north until you get to a bridge and go across.

========================
===Ambrossos Farmland===
========================
Go northwest right after crossing the bridge and there will be a road so
follow it. When you see some houses, there will be a side quest you can get
which gives 2 attribute points as a reward so it is worth getting. From the
houses go northeast and you will see a centaur, Chiron who will give the quest.

---Side Quest:The Good Centaur
Reward: 3000 EXP, 2 Attribute Points
	35000 EXP, 2 Attribute Points
You have to talk to him twice to find out what to do. After that go north
across the bridge to Chiron's Grove. You should be able to see a POI icon on
the minimap, but if you don't go north a little more and then head towards it
and go in. When you are inside, you will see a maenad with an aura. If you get
close enough it will run away. Fight your way through and follow that maenad.
It will hit a dead end and then you can kill that maenad which will drop

area with satyrs and centaurs and then there will be a bridge to cross so go
across.

==================
===Helicos Pass===
==================
Activate the Rebirth Fountain and then talk to Eurytimus to update a side
quest.

---Side Quest: A Proper Offering---
From the Rebirth Fountain head northeast. Ignore the first path going west and
keep going northeast. When you see the second path going west take that path.
Keep going west and you should see an quest icon on the map. Go toward the icon
and fight the boss. The boss is hard. She summons three spiders to help her
fight so that can be damaging. Ignore them, keep yourself healed, and attack
the boss until she dies. If you die, don't worry about it since the Rebirth
Fountain is close by. Just go back and fight again until you defeat it. AFter
that click on the Olive Branch to make it drop and pick it up. Keep it in your
inventory until you get to Delphi.

Head back to the Rebirth Fountain and take the southwest path. You will go
downward in a spiral.

---Side Quest: Goods Abandoned---
When you are going downward right before the road turns to the northeast, you
can go southwest between some trees. Follow the northwestern wall of trees and
you will come across the chests and get the reward.

Then go to the northeast and go under the bridge. Passed the bridge is a
Rebirth Fountain. Keep going northeast to the swamps.

===================
===Phocian Swamp===
===================
GO east all the way until you can't anymore. Then go south a bit and across the
little piece of land. Then go all the way east again and then north and then

the reward.

Now go backwards to the bridge and go across.

====================

a satyr encampment and go south to the next area.

======================
===Delphi Highlands===
======================
There will be two paths. One to the south and the other to the southeast. Take
the southeast path. Once you go southeast enough, the path will curve and turn
north. Just keep following it and you will reach Delphi.

====================
===City of Delphi===
====================
Follow the road up to the main part of the city. You will come across a Rebirth
Fountain.

---Side Quest: The Grieving Widow---
Reward: 3000 EXP
	35000 EXP
From the Rebirth Fountain go south and talk to Iodame for the side quest. You
don't need to worry about this until you are in Parnassus Caves.

---Side Quest: A Proper Offering---
From the Rebirth Fountain go north towards the POI icon and talk to Astyoche
for your reward.

Now go inside the temple and talk to the oracle.

   ******************************
***IV. The Source of the Monsters***
   ******************************
Go to the blue icon on the map and then go southeast to exit Delphi.

=========================
===Parnassus Foothills===
=========================
From the exit go southeast until you go through some torches. After that go
north until you see a POI icon. Head towards it and enter the cave.

=====================
===Parnassus Caves===
=====================
From inside the cave, go northeast down the stairs. Just a little to the north
is a Rebirth Fountain. Activate it and go southeast. When you see two black
holes on the map, go northeast between the walls. If you go northeast a little
more and see three holes on the ground, you are going the correct way. From
there go north and there will be three holes with a similar formation as the
previous ones.

--Side Quest: The Grieving Widow---
From the holes go north and between the walls. The monster you are to kill is
alone so it shouldn't be too hard. After you kill the monster, go back and talk
to Iodame for the reward.

From the hole go directly east until you hit the wall. Then go southeast
following the north wall until you can go northeast. The exit should be in
sight so get there ane leave the cave.

===========================
===Parnassus Hinterlands===
===========================
Right outside the exit is a Rebirth Fountain. From the fountain just follow the
southern wall through Cephesus Woods and back into the Hinterlands. The wall
should go southeast first then curve and go north/northeast. Go across the
bridge and there should be a portal, merchant, and Rebirth Fountain. Go east
from the fountain until you cross a stone bridge into the lower warcamps.

====================
===Lower War-Camp===
====================
There is a Rebirth Fountain right next to the bridge. This area is huge and has
a lot of mountain satyrs. You have to go east to the next area, but there are
a lot of satyrs here. If you can make it through, you will be at the upper war
camp.

====================
===Upper War-Camp===
====================
Once you enter you should see a man, Hylas, there. To the northeast of him is a
Rebirth Fountain. This area has a lot of monsters, mostly undeads. There are
some that will come out from the ground when you get close enough to watch
where you walk. From the fountain go northeast. When you see stairs on the
northeast corner of you screen, go northwest. Keep going until you see some
stairs. Go up the stairs and head northeast all the way until you can't
anymore. Go down those stairs and a POI icon will appear on your map. Head
towards that into the caves.

===================
===Pythian Caves===
===================
Go northeast and there will be a heavy wooden door. Get yourself healed because
on the other side are three gorgons. They are really tough if you are playing
single player since all three will attack you at the same time and one of the
gorgons is a healer so don't think about fighting all three at the same time.
Try to aggro one and run back so that one follows you and it will be a one on
one. Do that to all three and it should be an easy battle.

Once the gorgons are defeated, the door to the northwest will be opened. Go
through there and talk to the woman. After talking to her head northwest until
you reach a Rebirth Fountain. Go east and then south when you can and the POI
icon should show up pointing out the location of the exit.

====================
===Athenian Passage=
====================
There will be a merchant and Rebirth Fountain right outside of the cave. When
you are ready, go east of the Rebirth Fountain a bit and then go southeast
until you hit a wall. Follow the wall northeast and there will be a Rebirth
Fountain and go across the bridge.

=====================
===Kephisos Valley===
=====================
When you get across the bridge, there should be a path to follow. Follow it
north and then the path will end. From there go north until you see some
Spartan soldiers. Talk to Pausanias and Isarchus to get a side quest.

---Side Quest: Trapped in the Ruins---
Reward: 3000 EXP, Rare Weapon
	35000 EXP, Rare Weapon
This monster is really difficult if you are on single player. He does a lot of
damage and your potions won't be able to heal fast enough. If you are playing
single player I suggest coming back at lvl 18 or higher. When you do kill the
monster, go back and talk to Pausanias for your reward.

---Side Quest: Spartans Lost---
Reward: 4000 EXP
	37500 EXP
You don't need to worry about it until you get to the Monster Encampment.

From the ruins go east/northeast and there will be a bridge so go across that.

========================
===Monster Encampment===
========================
Follow the path northwest and it will lead to a fork and a Rebirth Fountain.

---Side Quest: Spartans Lost---
At the fork, take the north path which leads in to the Athens Marsh. Stay near
the north walls and run northeast and you will eventually see a NPC, Eryx. Talk
to him and then go back and tell Isarchus to get your reward.

As the name of the area implies, there are a lot of monsters here so becareful
not to aggro too many of them at one time. From the fountain take the northwest
path. The path will then turn and goes northeast for a bit. Then it splits into
three ways. One through the camp, and two around the camp. Take the north path
around the camp and go northeast toward a Rebirth Fountain.

===========================
===Athenian Battleground===
===========================
From the fountain, go north through the trees into the wheat field and go
northeast through it. Then go up the the area with the houses and go northeast
further and then east into another wheat field. From there go northeast until
you hit a wall then go south and through the barricades to talk to Leonidas and
head into Athens.

   ***************************
***VI. The Order of Prometheus***
   ***************************
====================
===City of Athens===
====================
After you are set, go northeast near the stairs and talk to a man named Kyros.
Then talk to the guy next to him. Then head up the stairs to the next area.

===============
===Acropolis===
===============
Go up to the fountain and then head northeast to the corner of this area and go
up the stairs. Go northeast a bit futher and the POI icon will appear on the
map and that is the entrance to the Parthenon.

===================
===The Parthenon===
===================
Go northeast and down the stairs into the catacombs.

======================
===Athens Catacombs===
======================
Go northeast all the way to the most eastern room. Then from there go northwest
to the northern most room. Go southwest one room and the stairs leading to the
next floor.

Head into the room to the northeast and then go northwest to the northern most
room. From there, ther is only one way you can go and that leads to the next
floor.

At the bottom of the stairs in a Rebirth Fountain. In that room go two rooms
to the northwest and then one room to the north east and the stairs will be
there taking you to the next floor.

Go one room southwest and then two rooms northwest. Then go one room southwest
and the stairs should be there.

Go toward the southwest and then there is one way you can go and that leads to
a boss. The boss is quite difficult since he summons skeleton spirits to help
him fight. Kill the skeletons first since you can kill them the fastest and
with them out of the way, you take less damage. Keep yourself healed and go for
the boss until he is dead.

Once the boss is dead, go northeast and talk to Phaedrus. After talking to him
go northeast some more and go outside.

==================
===Athens Docks===
==================
A Rebirth Fountain will be outside. Go southwest toward the docks and talk to
Isarchidas when you are ready to go to the next area.

From the beach go northwest and up the path into the village.

===========================
===Village of Herakleion===
===========================
---Side Quest: Xanthippus the Healer---
Reward: 5000 EXP, Greater Health and Energy Potion x5
	40000 EXP, Superior Health and Energy Potion x5
Don't worry about it until you get to Tritons Ridge.

---Side Quest: The Undead Tyrant---
Reward: 6000 EXP
	40000 EXP
Don't worry about it until you get to Tritons Ridge.

Once you are ready head out toward the northeast exit.

=========================
==Herakleion Highlands===
=========================
The next couple of areas will have a lot of maenads and some minotuars so
becareful not to aggro too many of them at one time. Now go northwest and then
a path will appear. Follow that northwest some more and then go across a stone
bridge toward the southwest.

===============
===Omphalion===
===============
Activate the Rebirth Fountain and then follow the path southwest a little until
you can't then follow it north and then northwest to another stone bridge.

===================
===Tritons Ridge===
===================
After crossing the bridge, go southeast and follow the road.

---Side Quest: Xanthippus the Healer---
Before the road turns go south and go toward the POI icon. Talk to Xanthippus
who is right outside the cave and then go inside. Go east and you should come
across a spider boss. It doesn't have an aura so you have to check to see if
the name is an orangeish color. Kill everything there and open the chest. Pick
up the staff and return it to Xanthippus for your reward.

Follow the road around the wall and to the northwest. You will see a small tent
and then a big one. From the big tent go north pass a torch and there will be
another small tent. Then go directly west and to the bridge.

---Side Quest: The Undead Tyrant---
From the bridge go north and there will be some stairs you can go down. From
the entrance go southwest two rooms, northwest one room, northeast one room,
and northwest one room. The boss will be there, but once you get close enough
more skeletons will pop out from the floor so kill those first. Then get the
boss. It will be easy since all it does it hit you with his sword.

Go across the bridge.

===================
==Kairatos Bluff===
===================
On the other side of the bridge is a Rebirth Fountain. Follow the northern wall
for a while and you should see a bridge. Go across to another Rebirth Fountain
and a merchant. From the merchant go northwest and follow the road up to the
palace.

====================
===Knossos Palace===
====================
Go northwest pass the first stairs you see and keep going until you hit a wall.
Then turn southwest and go up the first stairs you see toward the northwest. Go
north down another flight of stairs and keep going and go up some more stairs.
Go northeast until you hit a wall and then go southeast down some stairs and go
up the stairs you see toward the north. Go northwest into the palace, through
the court, and down into the labyrinth.

======================
===Minaon Labyrinth===
======================
Go northwest and when you see two pillars go northeast all the way and down the
stairs.

This area is a maze so I won't explain how to get through this area, but I will
get a picture of the map and the way through it so until then, you have to
explore and navigate through the labyrinth on your own.

When you get to the ornate door go through it. You will have to fight a
minotuar boss. There are some traps in the room too so aggro the minotaur back
toward the door so you won't get hit by them. The minotuar has either a lot of
health of a lot of defense. So if you are on single player it will take a
while. The only thing I've seen him do is just whack you with his weapon. He is
strong too so keep the heals going. When you defeat the boss, destroy the
traps, and loot the treasures. Go northwest into the next room to the Telkine.

=========================
===Room of the Conduit===
=========================
Go northwest toward the Telkine and then a firewall will pop up making it so
you can't attack him. He will send some blue orbs toward the statues on the
sides of the room which will make them come to life and attack you. You have to
destory them all first before the firewall will disappear. When it does go for
the Telkine. He attacks you by shooting a purple orb at you. He also has an
enchantment on him so when you attack him lightning surges out and hurts you.
He also summons some limos. They aren't too hard so kill them first to get them
out of you way. Keep yourself healed and beat him down until he is dead. Take
your loot and then talk to Kyros who comes out from behind a wall.

   *******************************
***VIII. The Blindness of the Gods***
   *******************************
Take the path behind Kyros and talk to Apollodorus to get to Egypt.

+++++++++
++Egypt++
+++++++++

======================
===City of Rhakotis===
======================
Go northwest a little and Imhotep will be there so talk to him.

---Side Quest: The Family Heirloom---
Reward: 6000 EXP, Relic Shard
	40000 EXP, Relic Shard
Talk to Anherru who is right next to the Rebirth Fountain. To get the sword
back, you have to the jackalman boss. He spawns in a random location in the
city. Once you kill it, take the sword and bring it back to Anherru.

GO northwest pass the gates next to the Rebirth Fountain. Once you get to an
obelisk, go northeast. Then take the left or right path around the buildings
and go northeast some more toward a Rebirth Fountain. Head northwest until you
get to an open space. Go west from there and keep going west/southwest until
you see a giant statue of some guy sitting down. Go northwest and into the
library.

======================
===Rhakotis Library===

fast. I suggest a hit and run. Focus on one of the guardians and hit him once
and then run away. Hit him again and run away and so on until they are all
dead. Once they area dead, go to the room behind them and get the Hand of

slope.

====================
===Place of Truth===
====================
After you get to the bottom, go directly east until you get to the wall. Follow
it all the way north and when you get pass the torches, you will be in the
Valley of Kings.

=====================
===Valley of Kings===
=====================
Go north a bit and then northwest toward the merchant and portal. Activate the
Rebirth Fountain. This place has the tombs of a couple pharoahs. The correct
one you need to get to is Ramses. From the Fountain go northwest until you hit
a wall. Follow the wall north and keep following it until it turns. Follow the
wall just to the north of it and follow that southwest and you should be
outside of Ramses' tomb so go in.

From the entrance head northwest down the hallway to the next room. This room
is filled with monsters. It isn't too hard, but if you decide to run, run
towards the northwest. You'll go down a ramp and then be in another room. In
this room go northwest to the next room. Then go northeast until you get to a
door. Behind it is the Telkine. Get yourself healed and go in. He can shoot
fireballs at you, summon some tomb guardians, and clones himself. When he
summons the tomb guardians, kill them first. They will get in your way and will
hurt overtime if you just leave them. When he clones himself, two more of him
will appear. They are weaker versions of him so take them out first. This fight
shouldn't be much of a problem since he doesn't do much damage. Keep yourself
healed and beat him down. Once he is killed, pick up the Cuneiform Tablet and
go back to the Temple of Seti.

When you teleport back, go northwest and Imhotep will be right in front of the
gate so go talk to him. After that go northwest outside of the gates.

   ************************
***XI. The Sickle of Kronos***

===Hatshepsut Path===
=====================
Follow the road northwest. There will be a Rebirth Fountain just outside the
gates. Keep following the road and it will turn toward the northeast. You will
get to the temple soon and when you get there follow the road up two ramps and
go into the temple.

==========================
===Temple of Hatshepsut===
==========================
When you enter there will be nothing here, but a Rebirth Fountain. Go northeast
and open the door to continue. There will be another door so open that and go
through. This room has a lot of monsters. I suggest destroying the two dark
obelisk first since that will make the phasma disappear. Then you can kill
everything else. At the other end of the room is a hole in the wall so go into
that.

========================
===Hall of Prometheus===
========================
This room also has a lot of monsters. It shouldn't be as hard as the previous
one so you should be okay. Once they are dealt will go northeast and down the
hallway. The path will split into three, but the correct way is the northeast
path. The road will split into three again, and the correct way is northeast.
You'll go through two more rooms and then there will be a door and through that
door is another door. On the other side of the second door is the boss. He an
easy one. He can summon some wraiths which you should kill first. He can also
do a sand attack. He shouldn't damage you too much, but if he does use the hit
and run strategy. After killing him, loot the place and go to the opposite end
of the entrance and click on the Eternity Altar and go through the portal.

the way and turn toward the northwest. There will be a Rebirth Fountain and

rooms northeast, one room northwest, and one room southwest to the next floor.

Go one room southwest, one room southeast, one room southwest, three rooms
southeast and one room northeast to the next floor.

has three southwest exits into three different rooms. One at the top, bottom,
and middle. Go to the middle of the room and take the middle exit to the
southwest room and go southwest two more rooms. Go northwest one room and this
one has two exits to the northwest. Take the northern most exit to the next
room and go northeast two rooms. Then go northwest one room and northeast to
the stairs.

Once you go down the stair, there will be a gate. Behind it is the chimera
boss. In the room there are also four frost traps. Destroy those first so they
don't interfere.The chimera can bite you, the middle head can shoot a fire
breath, and one of the other two heads and use a lightning attack that damages
you if you are close enough. If you have enough defense, you can just stand
still and attack him. If you don't, just run in circles and when you does its
fire breath it stands still so attack it from behind or the sides. It also
stands still when doing it lightning attack, but that attacks anything from all
sides so you can still attack if you have a ranged weapon. Once it is defeated,
loot the place and go one room northeast. Step on the symbol in the middle of
the room to open the door and continue going through to the next two rooms and
talk to Feiyan.

break off into two directions. Take the one to the east.

---Side Quest: Caravan in Trouble---

Just keep moving foward through the mountain since there is only one way to go.
You will get off the snowy mountains and back to normal land. Follow the trail
that appears after the mountains. It will lead to a bridge.

---Side Quest: Mystery in the Mountain---
To do this instead of going across the bridge, head north through the trees and
to a temple. Talk to Ang Tshe-ring to get an update on the quest. Go northeast
from him and go across a bridge. A POI icon should appear so go towards that
and into the cave. There are about four or five monsters in the cave and the
are quite a high level so the fight could be difficult. If you have a strong
attack to fight them all at once, use it. If you don't a good strategy is to
pull one at a time to fight them. Once you kill all of them go back and talk to
Ang Tshe-ring to update the quest. The next part of the quest takes place at
Tsongmo Peak.

Go across the bridge and follow the trail there. It will bring you back up to a
snowy mountain.

==================
===Tsongmo Peak===
==================
Go north after you get pass the torches.

---Side Quest: Mystery in the Mountain---
Talk to Da-wa Phu-ti to get an update on the quest. You should be able to see a
POI icon so go towards that and go into the cave. In the cave keep going
northwest and down to the next floors until you get to the exit. OUtside of the
cave is the boss. There will be other neantherdals close to him. Pull them away
from the boss and kill them first. The boss is very strong so if you aren't a
warrior class, then don't just stand there and beat him down, but if you are
then it will be an easy battle if you have high enough armor. He can summon a
blizzard attack and has a shout attack. For other classes hit an runs are the
best way to beat him. It might take a while, but you should be able to. Once
you kill it go back to Kilu Tem-ba to get your reward.

From Da-wa Phu-ti go east and toward the POI icon and into the cave.

========================
===Tsongmo Ice Cavern===
========================
Go to the Rebirth Fountain. Follow the wall to the north and you have to go in
betwen two holes in the floor. Go northwest after that and go down the stairs.

Go northeast first and turn northwest when you can and go down the stairs.

Just go northwest. Fight the yeti if you want to do the side quest or run down
to the next floor if you don't

---Side Quest: A Gargantuan Yeti---
This yeti is by itself. This guy is tough. It has great physical strength so it
will hurt when you get him. His other attack is an ice breath. If you get hit
by it, you will be frozen for a couple seconds and won't be able to move or do
anything except using potions. If you are a warrior class, standing still and
beating him down is possible. If you aren't then go with the hit and run
strategy.

When you get to the bottom of the stairs go north a bit and go northeast while
following the eastern wall and get out the cave.

=======================
===Khantai Mountains===

into two. Take the northeastern road. It will take around the trees and keep
following the road northeast. Keep following it until after you go downhill.
Then you follow it southeast.

==========================
===Village of Guanzhong===
==========================
When you see some houses, go slowly and try to pull some of the yerren a little
at a time because there is a monster in there that is incredibly strong so
killing all the weaker monsters will be better. When you get to the monster
with the aura, a hit and run strategy is good, but he has some skill that will
prevent you from moving so don't get too close. You might get killed a couple
times, but he doesn't heal so you can go back and fight again.

=======================
===Chang'an Farmland===
=======================
From the fountain, go southeast up into the fields. Then go southeast and go
pass the stone wall to another field. Go west to exit the fields and there will
be some huts. Follow the road southeast and there will be three huts in a
triangle formation.

==========================
===Quinba Bamboo Forest===
==========================
From the huts go southeast and go south when you can. You'll go pass two
torches. Get the side quest since it is on the way to the next area.

---Side Quest: A General in Repose---
Reward: 26000 EXP
Next to the torches is Rang Ju. Talk to him to get the quest. Go south of him
and then go southeast. You will go between two rocks and then go east into the
cave. When you are in the cave, go to the opposite corner of the entrance. You
will have to go northwest first then northeast. Go down the stairs and go
northeast a bit, then southeast, and northeast up the stairs. Go keep going
northeast and when you get to the chests, you will get your reward.

Go back one room and take the southeast stairs. Just south of those stairs
is another stairs taking you back up a floor and just go southwest to the exit
of the cave. After exiting the cave, go southeast. You might have to go around
rocks and trees, but just go in that general direction.

=======================
===Village of Binxan===
=======================
---Side Quest: The Hermit Mage---
Reward: 28000 EXP
Talk to Xiao Yishan to get the quest. Don't worry about it until you get to
Jinghe River Valley.

Once you are ready head out across the bridge that is right next to the Rebirth
Fountain.

=========================
===Jinghe River Valley===
=========================
---Side Quest: Behind the Waterfall---
Reward: 28000 EXP, Powerful Amulet
Go directly southeast after crossing the bridge and there will be a house. Talk
to Liu Xu to get the quest. From the house go west all the way. You might have
to go southwest a little, but there will be a cave so enter it. Go northwest
and then go to the next room. Go northwest a little more and there will be some
shades that have an aura around them. Kill those and return to Liu Xu to get
your reward.

Go straight southwest from the bridge to the other end of the area. There will
be a bridge. Go across and to the Rebirth Fountain. There will be a trail that
you can follow south to a village. Take the southwest exit there and follow
alongside the river to the southwest and then east until you see a waterfall.

---Side Quest: The Hermit Mage---
Go south from the waterfall and there will be some tigermen. Kill them all and
you will get your reward.

From the waterfall go south a little and then west. You'll go pass two torches
and be in the next area.

==================
===Qiyun Ascent===
==================
Follow the road across a bridge and to a Rebirth Fountain.

---Side Quest: Three Sisters---
Reward: 30000 EXP, Magical Jewelry
Talk to Yi Shan who is just next to the fountain to get the quest. Don't worry
about it until you get to the Jinghe Wetlands.

Keep following the path and you will go across another bridge. Go west all the
way until you hit a wall and then go up the hill. A path should appear so
follow it across a bridge.

=================
===Mount Qiyun===
=================
Follow the trail and cross another bridge. Follow the trail and go across the
second to last bridge and there will be a boss on the other side. The boss is a
fire bull. He can summon some shadow monsters and when he does kill those
first. He also has a couple fire spells. It hurts, but he doesn't constantly
cast it so it won't be a problem. Then he has a regular attack. If your armor
is high enough you can just stand there and beat him down. If not hit and run
is always a good strategy. This boss shouldn't be any problem. After you beat
it, go northwest and across the last bridge into the Jade Palace.

=====================
===The Jade Palace===
=====================
Go in and talk to the emperor.

   *************************
***XIV. Under Wusao Mountain***
   *************************
The easy way is to open up a portal and teleport back to Chang'an. If you do
use the portal to get back, you won't be able to do the Three Sisters side
quest.

---Side Quest: Three Sisters---
Go northeast of the emperor and go down through all the floors and you will
enter a cave. In the first floor the stairs is just north of the entrance. Then
go north again to go down to another floor. Go northeast to get down to the
last floor and go northeast to get to the exit which leads to the Jinghe
Wetlands. Go northeast toward the Rebirth Fountain. Then keep going northeast
until you see a pond. If you're not at the southeast end of it, then go there
and go northeast some more from there and there will be two torches. Go east
from the torches into some water and then go north back onto land. Next to the
house is Li Hua, one of the missing sisters so talk to her. Go directly east of
Li Hua and you will see some huts. Kill all the tigermen first. Then talk to Ru
Zhao two or three times and return to Li Hua to get your reward.

Back in Chang'an, go to the blacksmith and go southeast until you see some pink
trees. Go northeast and talk to Jing Ke to unlock the door and open it to go
through. Go northeast and toward the POI icon and go through the wall.

============================
===Forest of the Ancients===
============================
There will be Rebirth Fountain right next to the wall. Go east through the
trees and some of the ground will be white. Keep going east on the white ground
and there will be a cave. You don't need to go in so go northeast and there
will be a stream. If you don't see a broken tree that acts as a bridge, go east
or west a little and it will be there. Go across the bridge and head north for
a while and you should go pass two torches.

===================
===WUsao Barrens===
===================
Go up the hill and then go east toward the portal. From the portal go north and
enter the cave.

===================
===Wusao Caverns===
===================
When you enter the cave, follow the northwestern wall and it will take you to
the stairs that lead to the next floor. Go northwest until you see the
northwestern wall then turn northeast and go between two holes in the floor.
Then turn and go southeast when you can and head towards the POI icon to the
next floor. Just go northeast to the next floor in this room and in the next
room. GO across the bridge and take the north or east path since it leads to
the same place and keep going downwards.

========================
===The Obsidian Halls===
========================
GO northeast and you will see rock with lava spewing out. From the rock go east
and then northeast along the ledges of the floor until you get to a wall. Then
just follow the wall southeast toward the POI icon and go down to the Rebirth
Fountain. Then go southeast until you see a hole in the floor and go southwest.
Turn and go southeast when you see another hole in the floor and go northeast
the first chance you get. Soon a POI icon will appear on the map so head toward
it. Go down to the Telkine and you will have to fight it.

The Telkine can summon magma sprites so when he does kill those first. He can
make stones from the ceiling fall on you and then use those pieces and throw it
at you. He can also shoot fireballs at you. If you're high enough defense you
can stand and fight him while healing yourself since he doesn't do a lot of
damage at once. If you don't have enough defense just run around and dodge his
attacks while attacking when you can. It shouldn't be too hard a battle.

   ***********
***XV. Olympus***
   ***********
Go through the portal at the northeast.

===================
===Lower Olympus===
===================
There is only one path to go so you have to fight your way through. It is easy
until you get to the minotaurs. They are strong and they can stun you so you
can't do anything. Then there will be the cyclops. When you get close enough
you will be able to hear Typhon laugh at you.

====================
===Olympus Summit===
====================
Typhon is extremely hard. He has a fire attack that does major damage if you
stand in it, but you shouldn't be standing around in the first place. You have
to keep moving. He can summon frost liches which you should kill first when
they are summoned. He can throw balls of stones that are on fire at you. He
also has an attack that leeches your health and heals his all the way. He can
shoot lightning at you too.There are shrines all around the area so take
advantage of those. Starting from the south and going counter clockwise is
masteries, energizing, regeneration, frostbite, battle marker, and thorn. For
melee combat you run circles around him and hit him once after he tries to hit
you. If he uses his fire breath you can hit him a couple times depending on
how long he uses it. Having burning, bleeding, or poison damage will help too.
For ranged or spellcasters you just run as far away from him as you can and
keep attacking until he gets close enough then you run away again. It is hard,
but as long as you keep moving and not get hit you could kill it.

After one of the patches came out, you are not able to destroy the statues
anymore.

Another strategy I have for Typhon can be used by any class as long as you
have a minimum of 350 armor. As soon as you get into the circle area where you
fight Typhon, go grab the battle marker first then go get the masteries
shrine. Try to get Typhon to follow you and go to the regeneration shrine, but
don't activate it right away. When you are on the stairs and Typhone is right
in front of you activate the shrine. The shrine should heal you when it hits
you and his fire breath attack can't hit you. Just stand there and keep
attacking him. If the shrine isn't healing enough, then use a potion. Sometimes
he try to run away so go back and try to get him back there. If the
regeneration shrine is gone and it still isn't dead, then you have to go back
to the hit and run strategy.

After you kill him loot the items and after the talking, go into the portal to
exit the game, watch the credits (or not), and unlock the next difficulty.

In harder difficulties, your resistance will go down. You get better relic
shards, experience, and better weapons and armor.
