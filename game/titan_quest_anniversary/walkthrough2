===============
2. Walkthrough
===============
Ok, so you've decided to embark on Iron Lore's fantasy quest through ancient
realms. Prepare for a lengthy single player campaign, full of interesting quests
and challenges.
Note that this walkthrough is written for the Normal difficulty of the game.
If you are playing on higher levels, you probably are a hardcore gamer and thus
don't need me telling you what to do.

A. Main Quests
==============
__________

A1. Greece
__________

1. A Troubled Village
---------------------
This character will ask you to save his horse, which is being attacked by two
satyrs and one boar. The beasts attack the horse so you can easily slay them.
No reward however, just the gear dropped by the slain beasts.

Further northwest you can find the small village. It's entrance is swarmed by
satyrs. You can jump into the fight if you wish, but the guards have everything
under control. Explore the camp, find out about the history of these grounds,
activate the Rebirth Fountain and the Helos Portal. Talk to Diomedes.

Quest: Kill the Satyr Shaman

The target's camp is found in the Helos woods. I strongly suggest you circle
the village first, killing everything in sight so that you advance to level 2.
When you think you are ready, continue along the northwest path. When the road
is forked, take the southern most path. Take out all satyrs running towards you.
When they stop coming, assault the camp and kill the Shaman. Open every chest,
take any loot you can find. Once the quest is completed, return to Diomedes.

Reward: 1000 gold, 150 XP

2. Spartans at War
------------------
Diomedes will ask you to travel to Sparta and ask the great general Leonidas
to send a few men to help defend Helos. Take the long, dangerous road to Sparta,
trekking through Laconia, Laconia Woods and Laconia Hills. See side quests
section to find out what other quests lay hidden in these areas. Kill everything
around because you need to be as higher level as possible. Enter the Spartan War
Camp, via the Spartan Road. General Leonidas is in the center of the camp, but
his captain Brasidas won't grant you access unless you (did you think it would
be that simple?) slay the savage centaur Nessus, roaming the nearby Pellana
Valley. Buy some potions (at least 10-15, you should have more than enough money
if you followed my guide so far) and exit the camp. Proceed north to find
Nessus the centaur.

Quest: Kill Nessus.

This will be one hell of a fight. I was level five, when I reached Nessus and
I still had a hard time beating him, although I had killed everything possible
on the road there. If you aren't level 5 or 6 you should go back to the Spartan
Road before the camp and take the alternate path. You will find around 50
skeletons and undead monsters for you to slay. (You'll get two chests full of
nice rewards also.) I strongly suggest you clear that area.
Nessus is surrounded by his centaur minions and killing them will do you no
good, as Nessus will draw his horn out and summon more of them. So the strategy
is to kill the minions once and then lure Nessus further. This way although he
will summon other centaurs, they won't see you and thus won't attack. When the
big, nasty monster is dead, be sure to ransack his camp to find some nice gear.
Return to Brasidas, who will now allow you to see the general. Leonidas gives
you the next quest (sending you to Megara and Delphi) and your reward

Reward: 1 SP (skill point), 750 XP

3. The Words of the Oracle
--------------------------
The road to Delphi (via Megara) is long and very dangerous. Hundreds of enemies
await. Keep going and use a map if necessary. Pass through the Mycenean Ruins,
Tegea (solve the side quests if you wish) and you will eventually arrive to
Megara. In the central plaza of the city you should find Timon, the oligarch
of Megara. He will tell you that you need to bring something to the Oracle.
Timon will also suggest a gift, a branch of an olive tree. This opens up the
side quest "A Proper Offering", so jump down to find out how to acquire it.

Also, right as you exit Megara and enter Boetia, you will be attacked by
Polyphemus, an infamous Cyclops who destroyed the bridge to Athens back in
Megara (if you talk to the man near the bridge he will tell you it will be
repaired in a few days, but this never happens). He is the toughest monster
you've seen so far, even tougher than the spider queen awaiting near the target
olive tree. You have 2 soldiers standing there to aid you, but they usually die
quickly. Use a lot of healing potions, run around him and use any magic you
have on him, since he seems to take the most damage from this type of attack.

Once you solved the side quest below, enter the Temple of Apollo and talk to
the Oracle once to receive the reward and the prophecy. Talk to her again to
initiate the next main quest.

Reward: 2000 XP

4. The Source of the Monsters
-----------------------------
The Oracle sends you through the Parnassus Caves near Delphi. She states that
you will find your answer on the other side. On the road then! Go through the
aforementioned caves, killing as many monsters as you can, since this is a
great place to level up. Exit the Caves and enter the Parnassus Hinterlands,
where you will find another portal and a remote merchant in case you need him.
Travel way east and cross the bridge to the Lower War Camp. It seems that
the monsters are well organized. Just at the entrance you'll see some skeletons
with quest auras. Defeat them and a man, Hylas, will crawl out of his hiding
place. He will tell you not to enter the cave in the center of the camp, as he
has seen people turned to stone by the creatures inside. Now if you've read the
least about greek mythology you should now you'll encounter the three Gorgons
inside. Build up your level, until you are at least level 12 and enter the cave.

Quest: Kill the Gorgons

This is one rough task. The three Gorgons are grouped together, making them a
great menace. Go to the east side of the cave and try to lure one of them
towards you. Don't try any ranged attack and also disband any pet you may have.
My Liche King, for instance, drew their attention to us and we were both toast
before I could do anything. So, beware! Also, try to avoid Medusa's stun attack
since you will not be able to move a while and in this time they will probably
kill you. Use loads of potions, as often as possible. Once they are dead you
will get some great loot (items and around 10.000 gold) and you will also break
the spell on a petrified woman to the back of the cave. Talk to her, listen to
her story and end the active quest. Talk to her again to initiate the next
quest.

Reward: 3000 XP

5. The Battle for Athens
-----------------------
Continue your march through the Pythian Caves after you have spoken to Feiyan.
The road to Athens is long and the roads are packed with monsters. Continue
through the Kephisos Valley and the Monster Encampment, killing as many
monsters as you can, since you will later on need a level as high as possible.
When you reach Athens talk to General Leonidas who will be waiting after
the first two blockades. Talk to him again to end this quest and start the last
mission in Greece.

Reward: 2500 XP

6. The Order of Prometheus
--------------------------
Go deeper into Athens and on the central Plaza you should find Kyros, a member
of the Order of Prometheus, who is desperate because their leader Phaedrus is
being held captive somewhere in the catacombs of the city by a gruesome beast.
Enter the catacombs and start descending levels. You should find rebirth
fountains on level 1 and 3. However, the catacombs aren't as filled with
monsters as I would have expected. You can go through an entire level without
killing more than a dozen monsters. Anyway, get to the fifth level and go to
the rear area of the map, in a room sealed by two opposing doors.

Quest: Kill Alastor.

Alastor is an undead warrior, a wraith, responsible for kidnapping Phaedrus.
His main attack is a cold ray, dealing around 300 damage. In addition to this
attack, he also summons skeleton mages. Their attack is also based on cold,
but they only deal less then 100 damage. However, as soon as they spawn,
concentrate on killing them first. It helps if you have a pet, since it will
serve as a decoy. Attack Alastor when he is alone and use melee, if possible.
He'll go down after several hits. Having defeated him, talk to Phaedrus to
end the quest and get sent to the next area in the game: Crete.

Reward: set item, 5000 XP

_________

A2. Crete
_________

7. Under the Labyrinth
----------------------
Talk to the Ship Captain and sail to Crete.

Note: If the captain has no icon above his head and you can't speak to him,
then you have hit a really nasty glitch. Try reloading the game and if this
occurs again, you're in a big trouble...

When you arrive, go through the village. Activate the portal and get the two
sidequests in this area. Exit Herakleion and take the path through Triton's
Ridge. Cross the bridge just a few paces from the pillars marking the new area.
Work your way north and cross the next bridge back to the east side of the map.
Solve the two sidequests in this area, then cross the final bridge. Up north is
the path to Knossos palace. This is a tricky area in which you will have to
climb up and down some stairs to reach the entrance of the labyrinth. The
entrance is located to the far north. You should get there soon enough. The
labyrinth however is a tricky part. The first level is really easy as the only
thing you have to do after you descend is to take a right and follow the path.
The second level however is gigantic and full of twists and turns. It is the
most annoying part in the game, so far, in my opinion. I can't give any specific
directions since this would be very difficult, but I can tell you that you need
to go all the way north, then back south and north again. In other words, take
any paths leading up, until you can't go any further, then any paths leading
down again and one more time up to get to the Minotaur's lair. (It's difficult
to get there, I know...). This monster has four fire/freeze traps around him
and his melee attacks are painful. You will probably need many potions to be
able to kill him. First, when you enter the room, creep to the side and use a
ranged attack to destroy one or two traps. You might be able to do so without
him noticing you. Afterwards, start hitting him with whatever deals the most
damage (melee or spells). I wouldn't recommend ranged attacks since the
remaining traps can deal some serious damage and the minotaur isn't that slow.
Dispose of him, then proceed through the next door. Descend to the last level
and approach the back room. Teleport to the city if you wish, stock up on
potions and enter the room.

Quest: Kill the Telkine.

Right as you enter, Megalesios the Telkine will form an impenetrable barrier
around him and will bring four statues to life. The statues are slow so you can
just run to the opposing corner and hit them with some ranged attacks or even
spells. If none of these methods is convenient and melee is your style, then
use the same tactics: hit them hard and then run. After they are destroyed, the
barrier will also go down. The Telkine's main attacks are lightning-based so
resistance to this type of damage is crucial. He will also summon some
life draining limos monsters, who will replenish his life. Melee is your best
shot against this villain, since he can't charge at you as he could if you
were at a considerable distance. Just hit him hard, dispose quickly of any
summoned demons and he will die. Not easily though. He can take a few dozens
of hits, depending on your weapon. After you killed him the wall near him opens
and Kyros, a member of the Order of Prometheus enters the room. Click on the
magical orb the Telkine left behind to get a big load of loot (probably some
green/blue equipment), then talk to Kyros to end the quest.

Reward: Inventory Bag, Relic Shard, 7500 XP

A3. Egypt

(coming soon)


B. Side Quests
==============
The location listed below each quest refers to the quest starter. Quests are
listed in their geographical order (meaning this is the order in which you
will probably solve them).

__________

B1. Greece
__________

1. Monstrous Brigands
---------------------
Just as you walk out of Helos a shepherd will come running and tell you that
his friend has been dragged into a cave by satyrs. Continue with quest 2 of
the main story and stop along to way to enter a cave hidden on the left side
of the road. Enter it, kill the satyrs swarming around and at the back of the
cave you will find Tellis, the hostage. He will thank you and give you your
reward.
Location: Helos, Helos Village
Reward: random item, 300 XP

2. The Cornered Man
-------------------
On your way to talk to the Spartan general, just after entering the Woods area,
follow the trail of monsters on the right side of the road and it will lead to a
lumber camp set on fire by satyrs. Kill all of them and the surrounded man will
thank you for saving his life. (Although he is practically ruined now :P)
Location: Helos, Laconia Woods
Reward: 1500 gold, 300 XP

3. Medicines Waylaid
--------------------
On the way to the Spartan War Camp you will encounter a messenger from a village
plagued by a strange illness. He has been sent to bring medicine, but his way
back is now blocked by satyrs led by some sort of champion, he says. Proceed
through the pass, kill the 3 or 4 monsters who "welcome" you and you should see
the aura you should be accustomed to by now surrounding a big, nasty monster.
Prepare some potions, dispose of everything you can around him before he sees
you, but afterwards concentrate only on bringing him down. Once you succeed,
return to the village emissary.
Location: Helos, Laconia Hills
Reward: Replenish Life and Energy, some potions, 350 XP

4. The Lost Dowry
----------------
Just before the bridge you need to cross in order to get to the Spartan camp,
a Spartan peasant will approach you and ask you to retrieve the dowry for his
daughter's wedding, which has been stolen by satyrs after the beasts had raided
his cart. Enter the nearby cave fight your way to the back (why can't the stuff
we are looking for be RIGHT at the beginning of some cave or dungeon? Grrr...),
open the chest to get some valuable loot (or if not, at least a bit of cash) and
on the right side of the cave kill the big monster surrounded by the well-known
aura. He will drop the quest item you need. Return to the peasant for your
reward.
Location: Sparta, Laconia Hills, just before the bridge
Reward: Relic Shard, 400 XP

5. Ancient of War
----------------
Just as you exit the Spartan War Camp, you will find Euthycles, a soldier
concerned about his mentor's fate. He is somewhere in the Pellana Valley. I
suggest solving this quest after you have killed Nessus. After leaving his camp,
go forward and right and you should find Hippias, the "ancient of war", sitting
in a circle of beast corpses. He apparently decided he should rest for a while,
after he had slain several monsters. Return to Euthycles in the camp, who will
be happy to hear his mentor still hasn't lost his touch.
Location: Sparta, Spartan War Camp
Reward: 2000 gold, 500XP

6. The Poisoned Spring
----------------------
A young citizen from Tegea will inform you that the water has been infected and
now his sister and neighbour are suffering from a terrible disease. He suspects
foul play so he sends you to search for the cause of this infection in the
Tegean Woods. Exit to the northwest, fight your way through arachnids and meet
Pegaea the water naiad. She will direct you to the Cave behind her. Clear the
entire cave of beasts (be sure to empty it, kill everything moving around in
that cave), open all chests, get the loot and exit. Talk to Pegaea to complete
the quest.
Location: Tegea
Reward: Health Points (+75 in my case), 1500 XP

7. Skeleton Raiders
-------------------
Just as you enter Megara, a citizen named Nireus will tell you that the people
are terrified because undead beings have been ravaging the area. You are to
find the cause and restore peace to Megara. Proceed further into the city and
talk to Autolycus, who will also reveal the cause: three undead princes, who
have found shelter in an abandoned and collapsed temple outside Megara. So,
prepare some potions and take the path leading out of the city. In the far
north and after hefty battles you will find the temple. Enter it and search for
the three princes. Luckily you don't have to face them together, since they are
placed in different places in this large crypt. I can't give any specific
directions since they seem to spawn automatically. What I can tell you though is
that at least one of them will be in a room with an ice turret device. After you
have disposed of them (and ransacked the whole area; do not miss the small
sarcophagus-like crypts) return to Autolycus.
Location: Megara
Reward: loot, 2500 XP

8. News of a Shipwreck
----------------------
Near the shipyard in Megara, you can talk to Anton, a shipwrecked sailor who
wants to know what happened to the rest of the crew and the arms and gold (ding!
sounds interesting...) they were transporting. This quest is solved right after
prevailing in the fight with Polyphemus the Cyclops (see main quest 3). Start
walking along the shore, near the rocks. About 12 drowned soldiers will spawn
out of the ground. Dispose of them and open the chests around them (see, it was
worth it).
Location: Megara
Reward: loot (almost 10000 gold + great items), 2000 XP

9. The Good Centaur
-------------------
Northeast of the Bridge into Ambrossos from Boetia you will encounter Chiron,
a noble centaur. He doesn't understand why the creatures of the woods have
been enraged and asks you to retrieve his magical bow, stolen by Ino, a vile
princess who was occupied Chiron's grove. So head into the cave, dispose of
the creatures around and you should see Ino in front of you, surrounded by the
aura. She will however run every time you see her. Corner her down to the back
of the cave and kill her using melee (after you killed her minions) or ranged
attacks, but in the case you've got to be careful since her ranged weapon can
do a lot of damage. Anyway, after you sent her to a much nicer place, take the
bow and any other loot and return to Chiron for your great reward.
Location: Ambrossos
Reward: 2 ATP (attribute points), 3000 XP

10. Goods Abandoned
-------------------
Just near the exit of the village in Ambrossos, near the merchant, there is
another trader, who doesn't have anything to sell however. He was ambushed
by an undead army and he lost all his goods. He is happy to have survived so
he considers this event as a fair deal and tells you that whoever finds his
goods can have them. Great. Stroll to the first rebirth fountain you find (near
the olive farmer) and head west from there. Descend to the most western part of
the map and kill the several skeletons that spawn in that area (not too many
though, I was expecting a horde). Anyway, open all the chests to finish the
quest.
Location: Ambrossos
Reward: loot, 1000 XP

11. A Proper Offering
---------------------
Ok...This quest starts in Megara, but you have to get to Ambrossos to solve it.
Keep going on, solving side quests along the way, until you reach the olive
farmer. Go west and you should see the olive tree, guarded by something BIG.
It's actually Arachne, the spider queen. This is one tough battle, you should
know. She summons all sorts of Spiders and she also creates a nasty fog that
drains your health FAST. However, run if necessary, because she doesn't
regenerate life. When she is dead, click on the pedestal and pick up the
branch it will drop. Continue with the main quest "The Words of The Oracle"
and give the branch to the temple attendant to finish this lengthy side quest.
Location: Megara
Reward: loot, + 5% permanent resistance to one type of damage

Note: You don't have to solve this quest to get to see the Oracle

12. A Master Blacksmith
-----------------------
Admetos in Ambrossos will tell you of a remarkable blacksmith who lives alone,
somewhere on the road to Delphi. He is actually in Crisaeos Falls just past
the bridge to Delphi. Talk to him to end this mini quest, but don't rush to
buy anything since the merchants in Delphi are far better stocked up.
Location: Ambrossos
Reward: 1500 XP

13. The Grieving Widow
----------------------
Iodame can be found in the plaza near the portal in Delphi. She is haunted by
dreams of her late husband, who can not find his rest until the vile creature
that killed him is sent to hell. The horrible creature is part boar, part man.
The widow will ask you to kill the monster. You will find it in a remote
compartment of the Parnassus Caves. Defeating this monster is really a joke,
since he only takes 4 or 5 hits to go down and doesn't deal a lot of damage.
Once you disposed of him return to Delphi via the portal stone and talk to
Iodame to end this quest
Location: Delphi
Reward: 3000 XP

14. Trapped in the Ruins
------------------------
Near the entrance to the Monster Encampment, you should find a Spartan patrol.
They captured a fierce monster, but now they are stuck with him, as they can not
kill him (one of their men has been badly hurt... I wonder how they caught him!)
Anyway, they ask you to kill the beast. While the game will still list the
Cyclops as the toughest creature you've killed, this creature is far more
dangerous. So if you aren't at least around level 14 you should skip this quest.
The creature you are to kill is a magical limos who can deal almost 350 damage
in melee, thus probably draining more than half of your life bar. He also has
a ranged poisonous, life draining attack. Your best bet for this fight is to
hit him with some spells or ranged attack, have a pet harassing him and keep
charging. You should eventually defeat him, although it might take a few tries.
Location: Kephisos Valley
Reward: magical weapon, 3000 XP

15. Spartans Lost
-----------------
Isarchus can be found next to the Spartan captain who will initiate the quest
listed above. He will tell you that another patrol has gone missing and they
haven't heard of them. Cross the bridge to the Monster Encampment and head
east through the swamp. To the far east, you should find four confused Spartans.
Talk to their leader, return to the Kephisos Valley and talk to Isarchus to
end the quest.
Location: Kephisos Valley
Reward: 4000 XP

__________

B2. Crete
__________

16. Xanthippus the Healer
-------------------------
Hippocoon is located near the portal in the village of Herakleion. He will tell
you that the people in the village have been incapacitated by a strange illness.
Their healer however has been gone for some time now, searching for medicinal
roots. Your quest is to find him and send him back to his village. He is in
the next area, in Triton's Ridge. Follow the main quest in Crete and after
you will have crossed the second bridge in the aforementioned area, go southeast
in a remote area. You will find the healer standing there, but he will not
return to the village until you bring him his staff back from the cave nearby.
Enter the cave and kill all the arachnids since they are pretty easy to dispose
of, giving some decent EXP points in return. To the back of the cave, find the
Runelord arachnid and kill him. He is surrounded by other spiders, but he isn't
that difficult to beat. After you have killed him open the chest, collect the
staff and return to Xanthippus to end the quest.
Location: Herakleion
Reward: Restoration of Health and Energy, 5 Greater Health Potions, 5 Greater
Energy Potions, 5000 XP<br>

17. Undead Tyrant
----------------
This quest is triggered by talking to Diotimus. This NPC will tell you about
the long-dead king Leucus, who has risen from death and now terrorizes the
area. His tomb is located just north of where Xanthippus is located. Enter
the tomb and initiate the fight with the "fierce" tyrant. This fight is really
easy. When you enter the fighting area, he will summon a few skeletons. Let
your pet handle them if you have one, if not kill them yourself. Afterwards
engage in a melee fight with Leucus. He will go down with no more than 4 or
5 hits.
Location: Herakleion
Reward: 6000 XP

=================
3. Hints and Tips
=================

* IMPORTANT!!!
If your character gets corrupted (because the game can't save it properly),
your only hope is to use SSTQ Defiler, a small tweaking program for Titan Quest.
You can download it at http://tq.demortex.com. If this doesn't work, don't mail
me, there is nothing I can do.

* First of all, this game is Diablo-like in every aspect. This means monster
re-spawn all over the land when you load your game.
* Each time you load your game, not only will all of the monsters re-spawn,
but chests will re-spawn as well.
* Build your character carefully. You can choose two skill masteries: one at
level 2 and one at level 8.
* Portals and rebirth fountains always appear in the same places, but shrines
and treasure containers are random.
* You might have to talk to some quest NPC's twice.
* Do not get swarmed by monsters or certain death awaits. Try to lure them
away from their original area.
* Stock up on potions. You will need many such aids throughout the game.
* Only pick-up gear highlighted in yellow, blue (thanks Garth) green or purple.
White ones just take up space, as their value is low.
* Take the time to explore areas thoroughfully. It might net you important
experience points.
